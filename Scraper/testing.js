Undoing the harm done by the Iran nuclear deal needs to share the top of the agenda. In mid-October President Trump will bump up against a “certification” deadline imposed by the Iran Nuclear Agreements Review Act. The prompt was intended to ensure a much closer look at Iranian behavior and the Iran nuclear deal known as the “JCPOA.” Instead of sloughing off a threat that makes Hurricane Harvey look like an overflowing bathtub, this oversight duty must be taken far more seriously. Obama’s JCPOA is trumpeted primarily for one alleged achievement: it bought us time. In reality, it did precisely the opposite.  It bought Iran time. Instead of ratcheting up the pressure on Tehran on our terms and our timetable, Americans paid to give Iran time to hone missile delivery systems (Obama omitted from the deal) and get itself to the brink of acquiring a nuclear weapon before the JCPOA’s terrifying hourglass runs out. On August 3, 2017 Iranian President Rouhani said Iran will be able to start enriching uranium to 20% in the Fordo facility in only five days, and reactivate the reactor in Arak because cement was never poured into its core. His remarks were repeated on August 22, 2017 by the head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization, Ali Akbar Salehi. The Iran deal was exceptional for one other characteristic: it claims to put vital aspects of U.S. national security in the hands of non-Americans, the UN Security Council, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and our negotiation partners China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, the European Union and Iran. After all, President Obama went to the Security Council to adopt the Iran deal formally, and purportedly bind the United States in international law, before he took the deal to Congress. The complex regime for reinstating the sanctions that Obama tore up is intended to put American foreign relations in serious jeopardy should we calculate the necessities of our well-being deviate from the calculations of others. President Trump and Congress need to exercise their constitutional responsibility to move the center of gravity back where it belongs. In August, former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton (and Fox News contributor) publicly provided the administration with options. In July Senators Cotton, Cruz, Perdue and Rubio called for “a sober accounting of Iran's JCPOA violations as well as the regime's aggressive and destabilizing behavior.” So where is it?A third rubber stamp of what candidate Trump called the “worst deal ever” is indefensible. Outsourcing our national security to the U.N. is not a plan. The IAEA has so far produced six reports on Iran’s implementation of the JCPOA. The agency has been careful to indicate, however, its reports are limited by “the modalities set out in the JCPOA.” Moreover, in late August U.N. Ambassador Haley pointed to “military sites” and “undeclared sites” which the IAEA had not asked to inspect – and to which, therefore, it had not been denied access.  Even IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano said in March that he has no idea how many years it will take to conclude that Iran has no undeclared nuclear material and activities – because “it depends very much on the level of cooperation from Iran.”  As recently as August 29, 2017, Iran’s government spokesman Mohammad Bagher Nobakht unilaterally declared military sites off limits. Step back and recall where Obama left off with “certifying” Iran’s good behavior. In November and December 2015 the IAEA issued its final pre-JCPOA reports and found: \"...the Agency is not in a position to provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran, and therefore to conclude that all nuclear material in Iran is in peaceful activities.\" Obama responded by simply shutting down any further investigation of Iran’s pre-JCPOA activities. So now, as then, we still don’t know what we don’t know. What we do know is that the IAEA had already specifically itemized, in 2011 and 2015, Iranian “activities that are relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device…” and “specific to nuclear weapons.” And we also know that the pre-JCPOA certification scam consisted of Iran self-reporting. It reads, for instance: “Iran will provide to the Agency [IAEA] photos…Iran will provide to the Agency videos…Iran will provide to the Agency seven environmental samples…”Moreover, the JCPOA continues to give Iran far more than it does the United States and its allies, since it granted – for the first time – an Iranian right to enrich uranium, and legitimized a regime that had correctly been an international pariah. The windfall that Obama gave the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism, and close North Korean collaborator, via the JCPOA is a sunk cost.  This Congress and this president have no excuses to continue sailing the American people into a storm from which they will never recover.

To judge from the overheated reaction, left, right and Barack Obama agree on this. Color me curious. Once upon a time, we had a government where Congress fulfilled its part in the checks-and-balances system. But gradually, and almost totally on many issues, lawmakers became expert only at ducking and kicking everything to the White House. Because of that bipartisan cowardice, the estimated 800,000 dreamers remained an unresolved issue for many years. Obama said repeatedly he couldn’t solve it, only Congress can write the laws. Then, before the 2012 election, Obama changed his mind and, with a stroke of a pen, stopped deportations. But the “D” in DACA meant deferral, and everybody knew it was temporary and probably unconstitutional. The “D” in DACA meant deferral, and everybody knew it was temporary and probably unconstitutional. Congress, especially Republicans, was furious, and said it was their job. So now Trump, after zigs and zags, calls their bluff. It’s your job, he said, now do it. That’s what they wanted, and it’s how our system is supposed to work.

The president was right to say it is up to Congress to determine whether these immigrants, known as Dreamers, should be allowed to stay in our country. He explained that the Constitution does not allow the president the power to unilaterally change immigration law by executive order. Under DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), which was created by an executive order signed by President Obama in 2012, the federal government allowed children brought to the U.S. in violation of the law to get permits so they could stay here legally for two years at a time, with the ability to renew their permits.  President Obama said he issued the executive order because Congress was deadlocked and couldn’t reach agreement to pass legislation to fix our badly broken immigration system. Conservatives rightly assailed President Obama for assuming lawmaking jurisdiction, clearly usurping the constitutional authority of the Congress to pass laws. Even more egregiously, Obama achieved nothing but talk regarding immigration reform when he entered office in 2009 with a solidly Democratic Congress. He instead waited for a politically opportune time before the 2012 election to waive his scepter like a king and pronounced DACA as an edict. On the other side, many Hispanics and immigration advocates now correctly decry the threat of deportation facing Dreamers, who were brought to America by their parents and had no say in breaking our immigration laws. Congress should show heart and smarts through a three-part law that would help the Dreamers and at the same give America a sound immigration policy that serves our nation’s best interests. First, Congress must accede to the president’s insistence on a fully funded wall along our border with Mexico, which was clearly a foundational pillar of his 2016 victory. Our government has an obligation to secure our border. Second, DACA should be turned from an unconstitutional executive order into a law. But is should also be phased out, so that no more immigrants can sign up for the program. It is one thing to allow people already protected by DACA to stay here. It is quite another to make this a permanent program that would incentivize never-ending violations of our immigration laws. And third, the RAISE Act – supported by President Trump and sponsored by Republican Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Sonny Perdue of Georgia – should be approved by Congress. The legislation would transform our present chain-migration system based on relatives already in this country to one based on skills, so that we welcome the best and brightest of the world who also love our values.  Paradoxically, it is President Trump – so roundly and unjustly maligned by the mainstream media as anti-Hispanic – who stands uniquely positioned now to achieve this substantive immigration reform, and on “America First” terms. President Trump has, amazingly, largely secured our border only months into office and empowered U.S. Immigration and Customers Enforcement to accelerate the deportation of dangerous criminal illegal aliens. At the same time, the president clearly aches for the predicament of the Dreamers themselves. So he is in the best position to achieve a long-awaited solution to their uncertain immigration status. Many DACA residents know no other country, speak English as their primary language, work legally and raise children who are American-born.  I disagree with some of my Team Trump brethren who believe these 800,000 residents should be “returned to sender” to their birthplaces. In my view, they comprise a totally different category than adults who willfully broke our immigration laws. So Congress, I hope you enjoyed the August break that you didn’t deserve.

articles[4] = "\n                                     \n                                What happened?! Hillary Clinton obviously left off the question and exclamation marks from her book title, but no worries. If anyone has been confused about what happened last November, things were just cleared up by a simple meme on Twitter. The photo shows a copy of Hillary’s upcoming campaign memoir, “What Happened,” next to another book – titled “I Happened.” The second book cover shows a picture of a grinning President Donald Trump. Simple, funny and most of all, true. But if that answer isn’t enough for Hillary supporters, they have a chance to have Hillary personally tell them a fairy tale, but only if they cough up $150 to nearly $2,400 for tickets and the privilege of seeing her in the flesh. Hillary abandoned her supporters on election night, but hey, why go down to speak for free when you can wait until your book is finished and then charge everyone an arm and leg to hear your excuses for losing?The promotional material for the book tour wants to make sure you know how much of a victim Hillary really is: “She speaks about the challenges of being a strong woman in the public eye, the criticism over her voice, age, and appearance, and the double standard confronting women in politics.” The book tour promo material goes on to talk about the Russians. “She lays out how the 2016 election was marked by an unprecedented assault on our democracy by a foreign adversary. By analyzing the evidence and connecting the dots, Hillary shows just how dangerous the forces were that shaped the outcome.” Oh, so the Russians told Hillary to call half the electorate “deplorable” and “irredeemable?” Got it.            The truth is, in fact, boring and predictable. Hillary lost because of Hillary, including the conspiracy nonsense she peddles promoting “dangerous forces” as an excuse for her desperate inability to be honest and face reality. During the election, Hillary took supporters – and the American people in general – for granted.  And now she’s taking them for a ride. Just ask Democrats in Wisconsin, a state she couldn’t be bothered to visit during the campaign because, as the Borg know full well, resistance is futile. Until it’s not. So don’t fret Milwaukee! You are now on the list as Hillary is deigning to pay you a visit on the book tour. Yes, a year late, but she’s confident in her contempt, and she’s sure you’ll pay her to lecture you. On this day, as Houston is only really beginning to assess the damage of Hurricane Harvey, one wonders who could really use that $150 to nearly $2,400 that Hillary is pocketing for the pleasure of her company. People, their pets, and other animals who need rescuing from a hurricane’s bacteria-laden flood waters? Families who need shelter and food to survive the aftermath?

articles[5] = "\n                                     \n                                The most important thing to understand about President Trump's decision Tuesday to wind down the DACA program, which has allowed 800,000 immigrants brought to this country illegally as children to stay here, is just how legally shaky DACA was. Before issuing the executive order creating DACA – which stands for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals – President Obama had repeatedly said he did not have the authority to change immigration law on his own. President Obama then changed his mind. The courts, including the Supreme Court in 2016, enjoined a similar law for adults. Legal scholars predicted DACA would be declared invalid within a year. President Trump's decision to end DACA – but to allow a 6-month grace period so Congress can codify changes in the law that could let so-called Dreamers stay – is being attacked from left and right. To liberals, the president’s move represents the creation of heartless uncertainty. For conservatives, immigration hawk Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, says the president's action will touch off a \"big, civil war\" among Republicans. In reality, the president is this time keeping his cool and navigating the turbulent political waters here prudently. President Trump isn’t keeping the specifics of the DACA order, which grants a two-year renewable work permit to recipients while blocking any deportation actions against them unless a criminal record is involved. But President Trump says he will work with Congress to reach a viable solution. A statement by the president Tuesday echoes DACA supporters in one respect: \"I do not favor punishing children, most of whom are now adults, for the actions of their parents,\" President Trump said. Candidate Trump’s heated campaign rhetoric last year led many people to believe he really did want to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. But his attention-grabbing soundbites were belied by his previous positions on the subject. Back in 2012, when he was mulling over a run for president, Trump told an interviewer he was “probably down the middle” on immigration issues. After his election in 2016, he said he would focus on deporting \"bad hombres\" with criminal records and leave the Dreamers alone while the issue was sorted out. The genius of Trump on the campaign trail was that he sent two different messages on immigration.  On the one hand, he called for a border wall and bizarrely claimed he would get Mexico to pay for it. On the other hand, he said he would build a “big beautiful door” in the wall to let in legal immigrants. He reiterated that stand after the election, when he told a rally that he expected the wall would let in both legal immigrants and guest workers. With his acknowledgement Tuesday that he expected to sign a compromise on the Dreamer issue, President Trump is actually proving himself a good player in the game of the political two-step.  Activists on both sides of the political spectrum are upset, but the vast majority of voters in the middle will probably see it as a reasonable compromise. Of course, members of Congress are already posturing. Rep. Joe Crowley, D-N.Y., is accusing Trump of \"hostage taking\" should the president try to tie Dreamer status to, say, funding for his border wall.  But in the end, the political onus will be on Democrats if they block Dreamer legislation because they refuse to link it to any other issue. If President Trump plays his cards right, his move Tuesday is smart politics. With new guidelines in place that make it easier to deport unwanted or criminally minded immigrants, the president can feel free to be flexible and even generous with other immigrants.  The end result will satisfy neither President Trump’s most fanatical supporters nor his critics. But it is certainly likely to work better than the chaotic status quo on immigration. John Fund is a columnist for National Review. Follow him on Twitter @JohnFund."
articles[6] = "\n                                     \n                                Republicans have not convinced many everyday Americans of the rightness of our cause. So we need to do something different to get our message directly to the American people and explain how the policies we advocate will benefit them. To succeed, it’s time for Republicans to take the initiative and go on the offensive. We need to seize opportunities, streamline the legislative process, become less risk-adverse and not rely on the media to fairly deliver our message. Republicans also need to define issues, employ better arguments and make the Democrats pay a price for their unpopular positions. And we need to be as disciplined in governing as Democrats are in opposing.       Democrats attack. Republicans explain. Instead, Republicans should show the positive impact of our plans on the lives of individuals. And we should use charts, graphics, photos, social media and all the other tools of modern communication. Republicans are too defensive. Democrats are like predators that instinctively pursue their prey as soon as they see their backsides. Republicans should confront our opponents, not head for the tall grass. Republicans shy away from sensitive issues, such as immigration, even when our solutions are popular. For example, few issues garner 70 to 80 percent of the public’s support. But a program called E-verify does. It protects jobs for American workers rather than letting illegal immigrants take them. Other issues involving education, law enforcement, family and individual freedom are winners as well. Republicans should be as hungry for victories now as we were when Democrats controlled Congress. Some congressional gridlock could be reduced by Republicans ourselves. The House spends months on spending bills that will seldom become law and are not particularly liked by conservatives. The Senate allows Democrats to block consideration of hundreds of bills with a filibuster rule that dates back only to 1975, and which could be repealed easily. Republicans also could benefit by thinking of ourselves as bakers. We should realize that a half-loaf, or even a slice, is better than no bread at all. The legislator who refuses to change a word of a bill will never enact a meaningful law. There is rarely a touchdown pass in Congress; usually it’s just grinding out first-downs. There is a tendency, too, for Republicans to vote no: members of our party want time to look before they leap. But it’s wrong to compare what we are voting on with perfection, rather than with the Democrats’ liberal alternative. By only voting for perfect bills, we will pass very little legislation. And Republicans will then be considered part of the problem, not part of the answer to problems facing our nation and our people. That spells electoral disaster. Often Republicans let Democrats determine the terms of debate. Some of the nicer words Democrats use to describe Republicans are “vile,” “heartless” and “killers.” Republicans reciprocate by adopting the Democrats’ own language. For instance, they agree to call the media “mainstream” and Democrats “progressive” rather than the more pejorative term, “liberal.” Suppose Republicans took the initiative, defined issues, expedited the legislative process and became a united team. Would that guarantee success? It might help but, no, it wouldn’t turn the tide. Until Republicans acknowledge the elephant in the room – the need to combat pervasive and relentless liberal media bias – our agenda will languish. As a result, we will not be able to deliver our message because the media primarily give only one side of the story – the other side. Americans simply won’t hear what Republicans are saying. Or, if they do, our work will assuredly be presented in a negative way. For Republicans, the media is like having another self-funded liberal Democratic opponent. George Mason University Professor Tim Groseclose quantified the media’s bias and found that it was worth 5 percent of the vote. His calculation has never been refuted. So without a biased media, we would have had a President McCain, a President Romney, a President Trump landslide, and many more Republicans in Congress today. The media’s intent is to intimidate, silence and put Republicans on the defensive. It’s working. And Republicans are willing accomplices to the media’s manipulation. The threshold question is: Why do Republicans let the media tell us what to think? Why read liberal columnists? Why watch the liberal news? Ignore them!Republicans take the bait. We swallow it hook, line and sinker. When a reporter calls and asks Republicans to comment on the president, legislation, or the Republican Party, many eagerly comply. The result is inevitably an unwarranted and critical story about the divided GOP, our weak leaders or our flawed bills. Why Republicans respond at all – much less answer hypothetical and leading questions – is beyond understanding. It enables the media to influence GOP strategy and policy. As for President Trump, the Republican Party’s fortunes largely rise or fall with him. If the economy grows, if jobs are created, if the borders are secured, if taxes are lowered, Republicans will benefit. But these achievements won’t occur if the president is besieged by his own party and the media. The president has called the media “the opposition.” He has a point. He has received the highest percentage of negative coverage of any recent president. Two-thirds of Americans now think the media are hurting the country! And the media’s credibility is at a record low. Much of what the media report is exaggerated, biased or slanted, if not malicious. The Democratic Party’s enablers spend millions of a dollars on “war rooms” that provide members of the media with tainted information they readily disgorge to savage Republicans. What are Republicans going to do in response? For starters, we should cite examples of media bias in speeches, and in letters to editors and producers. We should form organizations that will educate the public about the facts and dangers of media bias. And we should flood social media with counterpoints to the liberal media and Democrats – the “mediacrats.” Media bias is a threat to our democracy. If the American people don’t get the facts, they can’t make good decisions. And if they can’t make good decisions, our democracy is at risk. For our country’s sake, let’s hope and pray that Republicans will succeed in being able to accurately present our ideas to the American people.

articles[7] = "\n                                     \n                                North Korea made clear its determination this weekend to keep advancing its nuclear weapons program, conducting its sixth and most powerful underground nuclear test only hours after claiming it has now developed a hydrogen bomb that can reach United States with the potential to kill millions. I doubt the truth of the North’s boast that it has already developed an H-bomb that can be mounted on an intercontinental ballistic missile to wipe out a U.S. city or a city in another nation. But we could see the North achieve this frightening goal soon unless President Trump acts quickly and decisively. Just last month in an opinion piece for Fox News I reported that a Pentagon source told me North Korea was only 6 to 18 months away from developing an H-bomb. My source told me this weekend that he still believes that but added on Sunday morning that “nothing North Korea does now should really make us jump out of our seat. At this point, I rule out nothing.” Yikes. The new North Korean nuclear test and the nation’s claim to have an H-bomb are part of the same strategy. For dictator Kim Jong Un to have confidence in his advanced nuclear weapons and missile delivery system he wants to test them, potentially on several occasions. I would argue that North Korea likely can already hit the U.S. with a crude nuclear delivery capability – now. So it’s an urgent matter of national security for President Trump and his administration to act to contain the nuclear and missile capabilities that Kim already has. So far, despite what Pyongyang has told us, Kim has never tested anything with the destructive power of a hydrogen bomb. Although, North Korea’s test Sunday was the biggest ever – roughly three times the size of its nuclear explosion this time last year and more powerful than the atomic bombs the U.S. dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan in World War II. North Korea would also have to miniaturize any nuclear bomb to mount it on an ICBM. Again, this is something else that would take additional time and would be a big leap for Kim, as well as fit the new weapon onto a missile. But whether it happens in a few months or even two years from, there is little doubt that the North is headed toward possessing the most powerful bomb on the planet and a working delivery system to many parts of the world, including our homeland. I would argue that North Korea likely can already hit the U.S. with a crude nuclear delivery capability – now.  So it’s an urgent matter of national security for President Trump and his administration to act to contain the nuclear and missile capabilities that Kim already has. As a first step, it’s time to pull out all the stops to make sure we restrict the amount of financial resources going into North Korea and make it as hard as possible for Kim to build up his nuclear program and H-bomb designs. The goal of this new action – like the last set of sanctions passed by the U.N. Security Council just weeks ago – should be to limit the amount of money going into North Korea that helps fund its nuclear and missile programs. President Trump needs to act unilaterally to name, shame and sanction any businesses, organizations and governments that help launder money for North Korea or assist the rogue nation in evading past or present sanctions. The amount of laundered money that goes to North Korea could easily amount to billions of dollars a year. This anti-money laundering campaign will undoubtedly hurt China and its banks here in the U.S., but it’s a necessary step to ensure Beijing and Pyongyang understand that evading sanctions that the U.N., U.S. and other individual nations have imposed on the North will no longer be tolerated. Second, we need to massively ramp up our military footprint in the Asia-Pacific region. President Trump should deliver on President Obama’s promise and actually “pivot” or “rebalance” to Asia. This would make Asia our top national security priority outside of the defense of our homeland, no matter what the international crisis of the day is. That means that instead of 60 percent of U.S. naval assets being in the Pacific we should increase that number to 70 percent. These new assets should be a mix of attack and guided missile submarines as well as AEGIS destroyers that can defend against North Korean missile attacks. Third, our land-based missile defenses in East Asia need to be ramped up dramatically as well as at home. We should work quickly with Japan to deploy additional PAC-3 batteries as well as deploy the THAAD missile defense system there as well. Washington should also work to quickly expand the number of ground-based midcourse defense interceptors that we need to defend against a North Korean ICBM attack. On top of this, President Trump should make clear that it is the policy of the United States that we will never accept a nuclear North Korea, and that all options still and will always remain on the table. While Washington will not start a war with Pyongyang, Kim must know we would respond to any North Korean military attack with severe deadly force. And if Kim ever launched a nuclear attack, President Trump should also make clear that the portly pariah of Pyongyang would be signing his and his nation’s death warrant. Today we are paying the accumulated price of having not devoted the required attention to a national security challenge that should have been front and center for every U.S. administration for decades. And while we might not have a perfect plan to mitigate the danger coming from North Korea, we do have many strong options that can collectively keep our nation and our allies secure. Harry J.

articles[8] = "\n                                     \n                                Newly disclosed evidence that then-FBI Director James Comey began working on a statement to reject criminal charges against former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton months before she and other key witnesses were interviewed by the FBI shows that President Trump was right to fire Comey. The evidence proves that Trump and his supporters were correct to say throughout the presidential campaign that Washington operates on a “rigged” crony system that serves the interests of the powerful and rewards corporate globalists to the detriment of the American people. As evidence of the rigged system, voters sided with Trump during the campaign in often citing Clinton’s apparent immunity from consequences regarding her unsavory acts as secretary of state, especially her hidden emails on a private server, as well as corrupt Clinton Foundation dealings. Given what we learned in recent days about Comey, the investigation he oversaw of Clinton represented the very worst of the rigged process. Instead of acting as an impartial, honest fact-finder on behalf of the American people, Comey behaved like a partisan hack. The former FBI director’s reprehensible behavior both during and after his tenure surely validates the judgment of President Trump in firing a man totally unfit to oversee our most revered law enforcement agency in our nation. The new evidence is revealed in a letter sent Wednesday to FBI Director Christopher Wray from Republican Senators Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. The letter is a bombshell, and didn’t get anywhere near the media attention it deserves. The evidence disclosed by Grassley and Graham comes from the Office of Special Counsel, a government agency that investigated whether Comey violated the law when he was FBI director. The investigation was closed after Comey was fired. The new evidence shows that Comey drafted a memo exonerating Clinton of wrongdoing as early as April 2016, even though Clinton was not interviewed until July 2016. As Grassley and Graham correctly stated in their letter:  “conclusion first, fact-gathering second – that’s no way to run an investigation.”In fact, after Comey wrote his “nothing to see here” draft absolving Clinton of wrongdoing, the FBI still interviewed a total of 17 key officials. In addition to Clinton herself, State Department Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, who was appointed by Clinton and served under her, was also questioned. Mills received a very unusual immunity agreement from investigators. How is it possible that Comey had ascertained, at such an early date, that the evidence would not incriminate Hillary Clinton? Such a prejudicial judgment certainly reveals a shocking level of bias and a dangerous willingness to engage in partisan politics. Understandably, President Trump reacted to the new evidence with indignation, tweeting Friday: “Comey exonerated Hillary Clinton long before the investigation was over … a rigged system!” Many Americans had already concluded that Comey’s investigation of Clinton was a sham. The majority in a July 2016 Washington Post/ABC News poll disagreed with Comey’s decision to not seek an indictment against her. The American people were poorly served by an FBI director who shirked his duty as a public servant. They thankfully delivered their verdict on Clinton’s suitability for the Oval Office at the ballot box last November. Adding insult to injury, Comey’s deceptive practices extended beyond his FBI tenure.  Once he was fired by President Trump, he again showed his true colors by leaking confidential information to the media with the expressed intention of triggering a special counsel investigationComey’s pattern of unethical bias, plus his personal ties to Special Counsel Robert Mueller going back many years, seriously tarnish Mueller’s standing. Donald Trump triumphed in 2016 because he promised to “drain the swamp” in Washington.  Sadly, the swamp has proven resilient, from Capitol Hill to James Comey in obstructing the president’s transformational agenda.

Donald Trump must have missed the memo. The president formally opened the tax wars on Wednesday with his speech in Missouri challenging Congress to meet his principles for reform. The media almost uniformly applied to the speech its favorite (though misused) descriptor: “populist.” But the real news was that Mr. Trump wants to make Reagan-style tax reform great again. The left saw this clearly, which explains its furious and frustrated reaction to the speech. “Trump’s New Tax Scam: Selling Plutocracy as Populism,” ran a headline in Vanity Fair, bemoaning that “Trickle-down is back, baby.” Democratic strategist Robert Shrum railed in a Politico piece that the “plutocrat” Mr. Trump was pitching a tax cut for “corporations and the top 1 percent” yet was getting away with a “perverted populism.” Trump voters had been “tricked into voting against themselves,” and now Mr. Trump was pulling a similar con with taxes. Nonsense. Mr. Trump is selling pro-growth policies—something his party has forgotten how to do. And there’s nothing very “populist” about it, at least not by today’s political standards. The left has defined the tax debate for decades in terms of pure class warfare. Republicans have so often been cast as stooges for the rich that the GOP is scared to make the full-throated case for a freer and fairer tax system. It was precisely the right’s desire for a more “populist” tax policy that gave us the Reformicons and their manifesto for buying off the middle class.

Late Friday night the White House asked Congress for $7.85 billion to fund the continuing federal response to the hurricane. President Trump has also pledged $1 million of his own money to help victims. Yet media attacks harp on criticism of President Trump for his conduct on his first visit to Texas not long after Harvey hit.     ABC News, a supposedly impartial source of information, ran with the following headline: “Trump thanks Texas officials for hurricane response, barely addresses victims.” CNN’s headline was similarly backhanded: “Trump wins praise in Texas, but keeps empathy at bay.” A Newsweek reporter chose to defend his fellow media members, claiming “reporters are rescuing people in Texas” even “as Trump attacks the media.”  Others shifted to climate change, blaming President Trump’s pro-growth policies for the devastating flood damage. The first line of a New York Daily News story read: “When it rains under President Trump, the protections will be poor.” A Los Angeles Times editorial urged the president to recognize “climate change is a global threat” in light of Hurricane Harvey. As if hurricanes and floods haven’t existed for centuries.  Now that the tragedy in Charlottesville has left the front page, the liberal media can no longer so frequently exploit the despicable actions of white supremacists to smear President Trump. So journalists are using their stories on Hurricane Harvey to propagate their anti-Trump agenda.  Far too little attention is paid to the fact that the president expressed his support for Harvey’s victims, saying his heart “goes out even more so to the great people of Texas.” And even before that, the president mobilized federal resources and provided much-needed leadership under difficult circumstances. He continues to do this. In addition, President Trump and his wife made a second visit to Texas Saturday, landing in Houston. Imagine if President Obama received the same negative media coverage after the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, when he failed to name radical Islam as the cause of the carnage. Not a single mainstream news headline read: “Obama thanks first responders in Orlando, fails to mention radical Islam.” The same goes for the 2015 San Bernardino shooting or the infamous Benghazi attack in 2012. Not once did President Obama forcefully condemn radical Islamic terrorism by name, which never drew fire from the liberal media. In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, ABC News opted for a puffy human interest angle. A 2012 headline read: “Obama meets with parents who lost sons in Sandy.” The liberal media purposely positions President Trump in a lose-lose situation. The same media that attacked President George W. Bush for visiting post-Katrina New Orleans too late blames President Trump for visiting post-Harvey Texas too early. MSNBC whined about “real concern” regarding the president’s trip, suggesting it diverts valuable resources from the rescue effort. No one in the White House is immune. First Lady Melania Trump was widely criticized for wearing high heels as she boarded a helicopter on her way to a flight to Texas. This despite the fact that that she changed into sneakers once the plane touched down. The New York Times devoted several stories to Mrs. Trump’s high heels and alleged naiveté. One snarky headline read: “Melania Trump, off to Texas, finds herself on thin heels.” The attacks became so outrageous that even Trevor Noah, the liberal host of “The Daily Show,” stood up for the first lady. The mainstream media should be ashamed. When the press exploits a natural disaster to score political points, it ultimately does a disservice to the victims who have lost everything in Hurricane Harvey’s floodwaters. Our attention should be focused on them, the first responders, the continued rescue effort and federal aid being provided – not anti-Trump zingers and high heels.  Countless videos have revealed truly awe-inspiring heroism on the streets of Houston and other parts of Texas. Americans of all backgrounds are helping each other stay safe. Ignore the fake news, watch these videos and pray for the people of Texas.

The Trump administration has already made significant strides toward getting the economy back on track, especially when it comes to regulatory reform – progress that’s been reflected in the markets. The Trump administration, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in particular under the leadership of Administrator Scott Pruitt, have taken a “smart growth” approach to cutting red tape and rolling back regulations.  Contrary to what many on the left may say, Trump and Pruitt are not anti-regulation as long as regulations aren’t overly costly and burdensome and they don’t hinder or hurt American job growth that is the administration’s top priority. As evidence, Pruitt was right to defend the EPA’s Significant New Alternatives Policy or SNAP program when companies from France and Mexico sued in federal court to have it scrapped. A three-judge panel ruled in a split decision, 2-1, to get rid of this program but there’s a chance the full court could reverse the ruling if Pruitt appeals. This ruling was unfortunate, as it permitted foreign companies to transcend U.S. private sector investment and innovation that led to job growth here at home and the exporting of new technology around the world.  American ingenuity, combined with over a billion dollars of private investment – without a dime coming from the federal treasury – resulted in the development of new, safer environmental technology, only to see a court side with foreign companies. The EPA program that created the landscape for these innovative, new technologies is actually rooted in the conservative environmental stewardship of former President Ronald Reagan and former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Pruitt should stand up for American investment, innovation and our workers by appealing this decision as there’s a chance the full court may side with him and the Trump administration. In urging him to do so, former conservative presidential candidate Steve Forbes noted the ruling hurts U.S. companies and workers who invest and innovate.  As Bloomberg News Intelligence chemicals analyst Christopher Perrella noted, “It’s good for the companies and it’s good for the planet. That’s a win-win regardless of your thoughts on climate change.” Under the EPA’s program new chemical technologies that meet the market demand for certain products were developed with nary a dime from the federal treasury. These new chemicals, known as HFOs, are primarily used for refrigeration in homes, in cars, in mass transit and elsewhere. If the ruling stands, private sector investment of over a billion dollars will have been for naught. The fallout could be even worse as the ruling will likely create a chilling effect (no pun intended) over American industry, as why should companies risk investing in the future only to have a court pull the rug out from under them?Thus the ruling, while initially unfortunate, presents an opportunity for Pruitt and the Trump administration to demonstrate its support for American industry’s ingenuity and innovation – and the workers who provide it – as well as its support for effective environmental stewardship. The economy is beginning to turn in the right direction and the United States is poised to be a leader on multiple fronts – including investment, development of needed technology, and the exporting of these products around the globe – which will only mean more good paying jobs for the American people.

And while you claim your name means you’re anti-fascist, you’ve shown by your actions that you’re really anti-American and anti-freedom. You’ve assaulted hundreds of President Trump’s supporters at rallies. You’ve vandalized property in the nation’s capital after the Trump inauguration. And you’ve gone on an arson rampage because you were upset that former Breitbart News Senior Editor Milo Yiannopoulos was supposed to speak at the University of California, Berkeley. In Charlottesville, you arrived on the scene with clubs and shields, prepared to commit violence.  Instead, your sick plans were superseded by the monstrous behavior of neo-Nazis, Ku Klux Klan members and other right-wing extremists as lunatic as you are. But they don’t have much of the liberal media working as agit-prop wings for them every day, like you do. If there’s anything you Antifa members hate it’s free speech, the Bill of Rights and the United States of America. In this, you have a lot in common with the fascists you denounce, as well as communist tyrants. Last Sunday, near your operational headquarters in Berkeley, you proved again that you are a nest of Marxist vipers. You went on yet another violent rampage, attacking innocent conservative men and women who were holding a peaceful rally. That’s your modus operandi: intimidation of anyone you deem your enemy through organized violence. You believe you are always right, those you disagree with you are always wrong, and as a result you are justified in physically attacking them to shut them up. If there’s anything you Antifa members hate it’s free speech, the Bill of Rights and the United States of America. In this, you have a lot in common with the fascists you denounce, as well as communist tyrants. You so-called anti-fascists are really nothing more than communists yourselves, aren’t you? I’m sure it’s no coincidence that your banner resembles the German Communist Party flag from the 1920’s. No doubt you believe that you’re on a roll and that through further assaults and intimidation you’ll be able to change the political climate and remake our nation into Soviet American Union. Nothing could be further from the truth. Here’s what’s going to happen:Your group is going to be destroyed – either by law enforcement, or by average Americans, or by both. At the end of the day, you will be piled on the ash heap of history with a myriad of other thugs, authoritarian movements and tyrants from the past. You’ve had a field day picking on college millennials and unarmed reporters. You’ve cold-cocked Trump supporters with rocks and attacked conservative women with pepper spray. And all the while, local police were forced to look on helplessly, under orders from liberal mayors who support “the resistance.” Newsflash for you: You haven’t actually met the real resistance yet, but with your determination for violence and bloodshed you probably will. The real resistance consists of millions of veterans, patriots and hard-working Americans who are sick and tired of Antifa violence and suppression of free speech. Many of these patriots would rather die than let the Bill of Rights be trampled on and incinerated by domestic terrorists like you. Of course, you could just stop being violent, stop suppressing free speech and go home. Then we could all live peacefully as free men and women in the greatest country on earth. But history has taught us that people like you are not going to stop. Therefore, you’d be wise to heed the words of the Bible and Matthew: ‘Those who live by the sword die by the sword.” You might want to put down your copy of \"Rules for Radicals,\" take off your goggles and masks, and think about that. More and more Americans are on to you. Despite your name, we know you are outlaws who embrace violence and hatred of America in the same way as the communists, the Nazis, Al Qaeda and ISIS.  Ray Starmann is the founder of US Defense Watch.

articles[13] = "\n                                     \n                                On Inauguration Day, leftwing protesters took to the streets of the nation’s Capital. They burned cars, shattered store fronts, blocked off checkpoints leading to the Capitol grounds, pelted police officers with rocks, and harassed law-abiding Americans trying to watch our 45th President take his oath of office. Police in downtown Washington arrested 217 of these so-called Antifa militants during what CNN called “ugly street clashes.” On the same day, police arrested even more violent leftwing protestors in New York, Chicago, Portland, Dallas, and other cities across the nation. The elite media went to great lengths to portray these attacks as isolated incidents. National news outlets emphasized the peaceful demonstrations by other distraught liberals, while conveniently neglecting to mention the many Americans who were peacefully enduring Antifa’s abuse. By the next day, most of the media had abandoned the topic all together, shifting their focus to more “pressing” issues, like comparing the size of the 2017 inauguration crowd with the attendance of previous years. Thus, the Left’s violence was concealed. But this was only the beginning. NPR described the attack as “scattered violence,” claiming it was “unclear how the aggressors were aligned.” Even after citing another journalist who said the violence was caused by members of Antifa, the network made sure to add that “the man being beaten may have been a member of the alt-right.” In February, leftwing protestors at the University of California, Berkeley rioted – causing $100,000 in damage to the campus – and forced the university to cancel a speech by former Breitbart.com editor Milo Yiannopoulos. A month later at Middlebury College, liberals shouted down political scientist and author Charles Murray, preventing him from giving a speech. As if this wasn’t enough to satisfy these rioters, a group of masked militants then proceeded to attack Murray, injuring a faculty member in their fury. In an attempt to rationalize the violent outbursts of leftist groups, the mainstream media characterized the speakers as controversial, provocative right-wingers whose extreme views drove the otherwise normal liberal Americans into frenzy. After the tragic events in Charlottesville, Virginia this month, the media rightly castigated violence carried out by hateful Neo-Nazi groups and Ku Klux Klan members, but they blatantly disregarded the violent acts committed by Antifa militants who were also there. In San Francisco this past Sunday, a small army of masked, armed Antifa members swarmed and attacked a group of conservatives who were peacefully protesting Marxism in America – as well as the police protecting the group. The Berkeley Police ultimately arrested 13 of the Antifa activists, charging some with felony assault, assault with a deadly weapon, and other violations. This was a clear, coordinated offensive on innocent Americans exercising their rights to free speech, protest, and assembly. The victims of this attack were not advocating for hate, racism, or any other malign or violent philosophy. They were opposing communism – a political system which most Americans have opposed for decades.  However, once again, members of the elite media have failed to condemn this violence – and instead have worked tirelessly to mute and downplay terror being committed by fellow liberals. On Monday, NPR described the attack as “scattered violence,” claiming it was “unclear how the aggressors were aligned.” Even after NPR cited another journalist who said the violence was caused by members of the leftwing Antifa group, the network made sure to add that “the man being beaten may have been a member of the alt-right.” Huffington Post writer Andy Campbell described the liberal aggression as “scuffles” in a piece that included the triumphant liberal subhead, “A Rally that Had Been Called Off Got Drowned Out, Anyway.” Campbell implied in his article that both groups engaged in violence and were arrested, which was completely, intentionally false. The Washington Post’s coverage acknowledged that Antifa was responsible, but they unsurprisingly managed to indirectly blame President Donald Trump. They asserted that violence “has become a regular feature” of his presidency and “gives signs of spiraling upward, particularly in the wake of the violence in Charlottesville.” So, the elite national media’s take on the violence in Berkeley on Sunday was: Yes, violent liberals attacked a small group of conservative protestors – but it’s not really their fault. Based on how the mainstream media has covered the Charlottesville tragedy and the protests in Berkeley, it is reasonable to say they believe there is no moral equivalence between violence fueled by bigotry and violence committed by people who hate others for their political ideology. This message is wrong and dangerous to our Republic. Even the few outside news outlets that accurately reported the event in Berkeley as a clear assault by leftwing activists on police and peaceful protestors, still failed to condemn these acts as threats to free speech and peaceable assembly – the foundation of our Constitution’s First Amendment. Prolonged silence about the Left’s violence is dangerous. It’s time for the national media to reflect and start condemning leftwing attacks just as vehemently as it does the brutality of Neo-Nazis, the KKK, and other hateful groups. Violence in all forms is wrong and must be harshly rebuked by all Americans. Newt Gingrich is a Fox News contributor.

articles[14] = "\n                                     \n                                As Harvey made landfall and was wreaking havoc in Texas, there was another sort of destruction unfolding in Berkeley, California, this one of the human variety. On August 27th, hundreds of Antifa, the black-clad violent fascist anarchists, set like locusts upon about 20 peaceful sign-holding Trump supporters in a Berkeley park, threatening, chasing and beating them. Yet something different happened after this typical scene of Antifa-organized violence—a major American newspaper told the truth. The Washington Post’s headline was shocking, not because of the subject matter, but because it actually reflected the facts of the matter on the ground: “Black-clad antifa members attack peaceful right-wing demonstrators in Berkeley.” The end result of the attack was like every other Antifa riot—people were injured, some sent to hospitals, and over a dozen Antifa were arrested. Up until Berkeley, which was not even one of Antifa’s most violent actions, the media had soft-pedaled the group’s violence. Reporters and journalists, inexplicably, generally refused to name them in coverage and worked to cast their violence as self-defense or action against “haters” or of course, the now ubiquitous “fascists.” Other headlines around the country about their brutality continued to obscure the true nature of what Antifa was doing. The San Francisco Chronicle announced, “Berkeley police identify 13 people arrested amid violence at right-wing rally.” The August 28 Washington Post headline and article, which bluntly laid out the truth of the violence by Antifa at Berkeley, sent a message to the liberal political and media world: that the romance was over. The Los Angeles Times: “Protests in Berkeley turn violent as counter-protesters, pro-Trump forces clash.” Really? There was no clashing, unless you consider a father and son Trump supporters running for their lives a “clash.” Antifa didn’t “turn” violent, they came ready to inflict harm. CNN’s coverage of Antifa has been Orwellian and even seemingly sympathetic. With a headline (eventually scrubbed) that actually noted, “Unmasking the Leftist Antifa Movement: Activists Seek Peace Through Violence,” they then compared Antifa’s rhetoric to Founding Father John Adams. Antifa is not new. The media know who they are and what they do. They are an extension of the “Black Bloc” anarchists best known for their violent actions at World Trade Organization and G8 gatherings. They were a part of the now defunct Occupy movement. Their current incarnation is as laughably absurd fascist anti-fascists. Reporters have been the subject of Antifa violence. One was arrested at Charlottesville for punching a female reporter for “The Hill.” On Twitter, various journalists reported being attacked or seeing assaults by Antifa on other reporters. Also at Charlottesville, Katie Couric tweeted that she and her production team were sprayed with urine, a regular assault tactic of Antifa. At a rally in Richmond, Virginia, one day after the Charlottesville horror, a local CBS reporter was hospitalized after being struck in the head with an object. Antifa admitted the assault on social media, which the reporter said began after the thugs ordered him to stop filming, which he refused. Then finally, the Washington Post story, out of the blue, naming and blaming Antifa, while at the same time making it clear the “right wing” victims were peaceful. In part, the media sees the message of anti-Trump Antifa as helpful to their anti-Trump narrative. After all, we’re told, Mr. Trump’s election signals the spread of racism throughout America. How better to facilitate that narrative than to elevate and highlight people who claim the urgent need to attack America’s growing problem with fascism?The August 28 Washington Post headline and article, which bluntly laid out the truth of the violence by Antifa at Berkeley, sent a message to the liberal political and media world: that the romance was over. Some didn't get the message right away. Just a few hours after the Post’s story, the headline in New York Magazine’s \"Daily Intelligencer\" column was “Antifa beats up Trump supporters, Fuels Right-Wingers.” Their spin against Antifa wasn’t that mindless, anarchic violence against innocent people was bad, it was “images of defenseless Trump supporters being mobbed by their ideological nemeses lent stark visual support to the conservative narrative that antifa is a menace equivalent to white nationalism.”Yet 24 hours later, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi issued a statement condemning Antifa which in part read, “The violent actions of people calling themselves antifa in Berkeley this weekend deserve unequivocal condemnation, and the perpetrators should be arrested and prosecuted…”It’s arguable that media’s choice to coddle Antifa came at a time when liberals believed it would help their narrative casting Mr. Trump and his supporters, as racists. That did not work, and in fact is backfiring. The Washington Post sent a message that the party was over. At least now perhaps we can expect more in media to be honest about Antifa and its violent agenda. Tammy Bruce is a radio talk-show host, New York Times best-selling author and Fox News political contributor."
articles[15] = "\n                                     \n                                America is reeling from the onslaught of Hurricane Harvey. In the midst of the suffering from the unparalleled flooding, we have seen remarkable examples of heroism and community coming to the aid of those in peril. Americans have been enduring for weeks media, the political class and their operatives malevolently insisting that all of America is hopelessly racist and its president a facilitator of white supremacists, so watching Texans helping their stricken neighbors has been a good reminder of who we, as Americans, really are. This is a small silver lining of a horrible event, as various malcontents continue to push on with their attempts to cast America as irredeemably irredeemable. Warnings of a “slippery slope” are often heard, especially when extremists demand the removal of statues they deem offensive. There are very sincere people calling for the removal of Confederate statues, but the organized left behind the hysteria are self-styled Marxists, specifically the World Workers Party, and anarchists, like Antifa. Attacks on a variety of cultural symbols is necessary to send a message that America was born of racism, is still racist and must be dismantled. Their concerns are not racism or even being offended; their goal is to condemn the United States and capitalism. For them, the only way to remake society is to rebuild it from ashes. Attacks on a variety of cultural symbols is necessary to send a message that America was born of racism, is still racist and must be dismantled. Cases in point: A CBS New York headline: “New York City ‘Symbols Of Hate’ Purge Could Target Columbus Statue, Grant’s Tomb.” President Grant, you see, is regarded by some as anti-Semitic. ESPN removing a sportscaster named Robert Lee from working a University of Virginia game to avoid imagined backlash, is now infamous. It was also so incomprehensible many, including this columnist, simply didn’t believe it. It was true, and a sign of how perceived public pressure as promulgated by media, and the fear of violence, produces a mass hysteria that facilitates the craven Marxist agenda embraced by so few. We also now have what is known as the “Traveler Mascot Controversy.” You see, the University of Southern California’s mascot’s horse has a name similar to Robert E. Lee’s horse, ergo, Traveler must go. Free Beacon reports, “Saphia Jackson, USC’s Black Student Assembly co-president, accused Traveler IX last week of being a symbol of white supremacy, and said it should be removed from campus.” The good news is someone is standing up to this absurdity: “An acclaimed sports broadcaster [Brent Musberger] said Sunday on Barstool Sports’ podcast ‘Pardon My Take’ that he would not vote for University of Southern California quarterback Sam Darnold to receive the Heisman Trophy if the university were to change its mascot’s name,” The Washington Free Beacon reported. But let’s not stop there. A writer at Salon, a far-left website, has declared, according to The Daily Caller, that “The Star-Spangled Banner” is America’s national anthem because “neo-Confederates elevated” the song “as a way of honoring Southern slaveowners’ rebellion.” The reasoning behind all this, the writer attests, is due to the “popular awakening” reflected in the demand to remove offensive statues. Not everything is as camera-ready as the defacing, beheading and tearing down of statues. After featuring the iconic American film, “Gone with the Wind” for 34 years, a Memphis theater announced it will no longer screen the film once a year at its festival. The New York Times noted the theater was removing it due to its “insensitive” nature and because of a “heated” online discussion. The decision was met with even more discussion, online and in the press. USA Today reported on the social media outrage, “Even a French cultural icon, erudite philosopher and cineaste Bernard-Henri Levy, had something to say in 140 characters, joining right-wing critics in condemning restraint on free expression. ‘Appalled by #Gonewiththewind cancellation at Memphis Orpheum Theater: alarming suppression of artistic expression,’ Mr. Levy declared on Twitter.” Columnist John Nolte perfectly notes on the fecklessness of the censors, “There is no moral difference between a community library bullied into removing a book and a community theater bullied into canceling a screening. Moreover, there is no moral difference between a mob burning a book and a mob bullying a film group into memory-holing a movie.” The good news in all of this bullying by a few hostile Marxists, who can organize online, are the facts of the matter. Mr. Nolte points out that 73 percent of African-Americans “rank ‘Gone With the Wind’ as a good/very good movie? That is only 14 points lower than whites. Our media would never tell you that. Doesn’t fit the narrative.” Moreover, in the wake of Charlottesville, the Federalist reported that a new poll “shows that most Americans, including a plurality of African-Americans, don’t agree with efforts to tear down Confederate statues. According to a new poll conducted by Marist for NPR/PBS News Hour, 62 percent of Americans want the statues to stay where they are.” One message for all of us is to not let volume or intensity of news coverage dictate reality. These issues are complex even without agitation from leftists who have no one’s best interests in mind. Having serious discussions about who we are as Americans has allowed us to become better people. If we acquiesce to a small cadre of leftist bullies and censors, they’ll not only wipe away the past, the future is gone as well.

articles[16] = "\n                                     \n                                In a scathing August 24 New York Times op-ed, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a Somali-born feminist, author, scholar and former Dutch parliament member, lamented that the far-left Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) “has hit the jackpot” in huge donations in the aftermath of the violence in Charlottesville.  Hirsi Ali noted that Apple pledged $1 million to the SPLC; JP Morgan Chase & Co. half a million; George and Amal Clooney $1 million. While Hirsi Ali condemned Nazism, white supremacy and racial bigotry as having no place in a civilized society, she made it clear that contributing to the SPLC is the wrong way to combat this poison. As I explained in a 2016 Fox News Opinion article, the Southern Poverty Law Center is a left wing smear machine that tries to denigrate conservative individuals and organizations by lumping them together with white nationalists, KKK members and neo-Nazis on so-called hate lists. In a recent Frontpage Magazine article, Daniel Greenfield described the SPLC as “one of the longest running malicious jokes on the internet.”  Conservatives targeted by the SPLC include American Enterprise Institute scholar Charles Murray, Accuracy in Media President Cliff Kinkaid (who SPLC has singled out for challenging global warming), the Family Research Council, and WorldNetDaily founder Joseph Farah. Smearing anyone who speaks out against radical Islam is one of the SPLC’s priorities.  Accordingly, it has placed on its hate lists Jihad Watch and its Director Robert Spencer; American Freedom Defense Initiative and its director Pamela Geller; and Maajid Nawaz a Muslim reformer who runs Quilliam, a London-based organization that aims to counter jihadism and extremism.  My organization, the Center for Security Policy and our president Frank Gaffney, also are on the SPLC’s hate lists due to our principled stand against the Global Jihad Movement. Despite how transparently political the SPLC’s hate lists are, the main stream media regularly cites them as authoritative sources.  Last October, the SPLC added Ayaan Hirsi Ali to its hate list, an appalling act that ignored the decades of intimidation, hatred and fear Ms. Hirsi Ali has endured from radical Islamists.  This decision also reflected the SPLC’s disgraceful practice of turning a blind eye to the violent hatred and extremism of radical Islam, which Hirsi Ali noted in her op-ed includes weekly killing sprees around the world, justifying wife-beating, enslavement of female unbelievers, murdering gay people and virulent anti-Semitism. The violence, hatred and intimidation radical Islamists have inflicted on Ayaan Hirsi Ali have been extreme.  She was subjected to female genital mutilation (FGM) at the age of five when she lived in Somalia.  She fled to the Netherlands to escape an arranged marriage.  After becoming a Dutch citizen, Hirsi Ali was elected to the Dutch Parliament and began working on a film with filmmaker Theo van Gogh titled “Submission” on the oppression of women under Islam.  Van Gogh was assassinated by a radical Islamist for making this film.  After other radical Islamists threatened to kill Hirsi Ali for her work on the film, she was forced to live in a secret location in the Netherlands under high security. Hirsi Ali moved to the United States in 2006 and is now a fellow at Harvard University’s JFK School of Government and a Research Fellow at the Hoover Institution.  She has written two best-selling books, \"Infidel\" (which chronicles her life) and \"Heretic: Why Islam Needs Reformation Now.\"  Because of continuing threats against her life by radical Islamists, Hirsi Ali lives with round-the-clock security and does not travel without an armed security detail. Despite how transparently political the SPLC’s hate lists are, the main stream media regularly cites them as authoritative sources.  CNN recently ran a story about hate groups in the U.S. citing these hate lists which it was forced to partially retract after a backlash by conservatives.  Because of this CNN article and other recent misleading press stories driven by the SPLC, PayPal suspended the accounts of Robert Spencer, Pamela Geller and their organizations.  Fortunately, another backlash forced PayPal to quickly reverse this decision. Targeting conservatives as haters has been very profitable for the SPLC.  It uses its hate lists to generate huge donations, in part through a sophisticated direct mail fundraising operation.  Based on its 2010 tax return, the liberal website Daily Kos criticized the SPLC in 2012 for its enormous wealth, offshore bank account in the Cayman Islands, and ownership in several foreign corporations. Ayaan Hirsi Ali concluded her op-ed by cheering efforts to stand up to neo-Nazi displays like what happened in Charlottesville.   But she urged Apple, JP Morgan and the Hollywood A-list to find more trustworthy and deserving partners to work with other than the odious SPLC to counter this and all other forms of political violence and intolerance. Let’s hope Apple and George Clooney haven't mailed in their checks yet.

Antifa and the white nationalists are, in fact, kissing cousins, just as the Nazis and communists were. In fact, communist rhetoric has long called itself anti-fascist. The Berlin Wall was, in East Germany, officially called the Anti-Fascist Protection Barrier. But the white nationalists and Antifa are pretty much the same, working at opposite ends of the political spectrum. One has a swastika. The other has a hammer and sickle. Both are symbols of repressive, murderous regimes. The only significant difference is that members of the media and much of the political left give Antifa the veneer of moral crusade that no one gives the white nationalists. But Antifa does not deserve it. Time and time again, Antifa is violent and thuggish. They claim anyone they attack deserves it, just like the white nationalists claim minorities deserve it. If the left does not do a better job of vocally condemning Antifa, there really well be less people on the right willing to condemn the white nationalists. And both will, as a result, have breathing room to grow when both should be stamped out. On \"Meet the Press\" just two days ago, a Dartmouth professor tried to justify Antifa’s violence. But the violence is not justified and, as we are seeing in Berkeley and elsewhere, the excuse of “punching Nazis” has become justification to punch anyone who is not with Antifa. The truth is that if the left does not do a better job of vocally condemning Antifa, there really well be less people on the right willing to condemn the white nationalists. And both will, as a result, have breathing room to grow when both should be stamped out. Antifa dresses in black. The white nationalists dress in white. They otherwise use the same tactics to advance the same goal — shutting down those who oppose them through any means necessary. Polite society needs to shut them both down and the left needs to drop their claims of moral justification for Antifa’s actions. Erick Erickson is a Fox News contributor.

The most recent average of polls has President Trump at 39 percent approval. One news analyst wrote that Trump is turning us from a 50-50 country to a 60-40 country, with the new majority consolidating against the president. In their eagerness to declare the Trump presidency a failure, the elite media is failing to inform us of two things. Macron is not alone. British Prime Minister Theresa May earned a 34 percent satisfaction rate, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had a July approval rating of 34.2 percent, and the Democratic Party in the United States received 38 percent approval in June.  First, President Reagan had a similar period during his first term when his approval rating fell to 35 percent -- even lower than President Trump’s. Reagan bounced back, carried 49 states in a landslide reelection, and went on to oversee an economic boom and change world history by pushing the Soviet Union into collapse. So, history tells us that presidential approval ratings at this point in time are not indicative of a president’s future success.    Second, in addition to failing to contextualize President Trump’s approval ratings in history, the elite media is ignoring the present. Look, for example, at the radically different way it has treated President Trump and President Emmanuel Macron of France. According to the elite media, Macron is the brilliant young technocrat who saved France from Marine Le Pen and Trump-like populism. Macron won with a stunning 66 percent of the vote. He formed a new party which swept the legislative elections, giving him a unique opportunity to reform France. The news media loved him. They lionized him because he was seen as the anti-Trump. Macron was smooth where Trump was rough. Macron was sophisticated and international where Trump was an American populist (oh how it pains the elite media to have a crude populist as their president when they could have someone elegant who understands fine wine and cheese). Unfortunately for the elite media, the Macron myth has not aged well. As voters came to know him, they were put off by his icy, imperialist aloofness. As they came to understand his proposed reforms, they decided they opposed them. Macron was at 64 percent approval in June. Now, less than two months later, he has fallen to 36 percent.... BELOW TRUMP. How can the elite media explain this collapse? How can the elite media rationalize that their young, moderate, sophisticated technocrat is now below President Trump? They can't. So, they don't. However, Macron is not alone. The elite media has also failed to inform viewers that the approval ratings of other world leaders have been recorded at similarly low levels in recent months. For example, British Prime Minister Theresa May earned a 34 percent satisfaction rate, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had a July approval rating of 34.2 percent, and the Democratic Party in the United States received 38 percent approval in June. All of these approval ratings are lower than President Trump’s - but you don’t see the elite media fighting to break that news story. So, the next time you watch biased and uninformed TV pundits opine on President Trump's approval ratings, remember two things: President Reagan’s 49 state reelection victory in 1984 and the current ratings of other world leaders. Then relax and enjoy the nonsense knowing it is just that: nonsense.  Newt Gingrich is a Fox News contributor.

articles[19] = "Is America racist? It used to be that racism meant the actual enforcement of bigotry—the routine implementation of racial inequality everywhere in public and private life. Racism was a tyranny and an oppression that dehumanized—animalized—the “other.” It was a social malignancy, yet it carried the authority of natural law, as if God himself had dispassionately ordained it. Today Americans know that active racism is no longer the greatest barrier to black and minority advancement. Since the 1960s other pathologies, even if originally generated by racism, have supplanted it. White racism did not shoot more than 4,000 people last year in Chicago. To the contrary, America for decades now—with much genuine remorse—has been recoiling from the practice of racism and has gained a firm intolerance for what it once indulged. But Americans don’t really trust the truth of this. It sounds too self-exonerating. Talk of “structural” and “systemic” racism conditions people to think of it as inexorable, predestined. So even if bigotry and discrimination have lost much of their menace, Americans nevertheless yearn to know whether or not we are a racist people.

He vowed to end it on Day One of his administration. But thus far, he has kept the program in place -- even though federal courts have found DACA to be an illegal overreach of executive authority, and the Trump Administration already ended a companion program that granted reprieves and work permits to parents of DACA recipients. The Constitution gives Congress -- not the president -- the authority to determine who may legally enter and reside in the United States. It's time for President Trump to fulfill his vow. DACA is flagrantly unconstitutional. And it hurts vulnerable American workers.  The Constitution gives Congress -- not the president -- the authority to determine who may legally enter and reside in the United States. One year before enacting DACA, President Obama himself explained \"With respect to the notion that I can just suspend deportations through executive order, that's just not the case, because there are laws on the books that Congress has passed.\"  But President Obama and his lawyers found what they thought was a clever way around this constitutional barrier. DACA, they said, doesn't give permanent legal residency to illegal aliens.  It merely makes them a very, very low priority for deportation. Such a low priority, in fact, that all 750,000 illegal aliens who signed up for the program would receive an official card instructing Immigration and Customs Enforcement not to deport them unless they committed multiple criminal offenses. It's highly questionable whether the executive branch has this much leeway to selectively enforce Congress' immigration laws. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Andrew Hanen, who issued an injunction freezing an expansion of the DACA program in 2015, explained that, \"DHS cannot reasonably claim that, under a general delegation to establish enforcement policies, it can establish a blanket policy of non-enforcement that also awards legal presence and benefits to otherwise removable aliens.\"  Even supporters of amnesty for illegal aliens agree DACA is unconstitutional. In December, Senator Lindsay Graham tweeted, \"In my view, the DACA Executive Order issued by President Obama was unconstitutional and President-elect Trump would be right to repeal it.\"  For reference, Sen. Graham has sponsored the DREAM Act, a bill that would give U.S. citizenship to illegal aliens who came here as children.  Even if the executive branch did have authority to exempt an entire class of people from deportation, DACA would still be unconstitutional. That's because the president doesn't have the authority to hand out work permits to illegal aliens. As Judge Hanen noted, \"Exercising prosecutorial discretion... does not also entail bestowing benefits.\"  Legal arguments aside, the DACA program hurts American workers. An alarming number of American workers without college degrees are struggling to find work. In the first quarter of 2017, nearly four in ten native-born 18 to 29-year olds without college degrees were either unemployed or not in the labor force.   Illegal immigration exacerbates these young Americans' struggles by increasing the number of people competing for a limited supply of lower-skilled and entry-level jobs. Over the past 20 years, illegal aliens without high school degrees have inflated the low-skill U.S. workforce by approximately 22 percent.     The excess of low-skilled workers means companies don't need to raise wages to fill positions. Native-born workers without a high school degree would earn nearly $800 more annually if there were no illegal immigration.  The burdens of illegal immigration disproportionately fall on American minorities. Harvard Kennedy School economics professor George Borjas' explains that \"Because a disproportionate percentage of immigrants have few skills, it is low-skilled American workers, including many blacks and Hispanics, who have suffered most from this wage dip.\"  Put simply, our most economically vulnerable citizens have the most to lose if President Trump preserves the DACA program.  President Trump repeatedly vowed to end DACA to protect American workers and the rule of law. It's time for him to follow through on this promise.   Bruce C.

articles[21] = " \n                                   Imran Awan was arrested at Dulles International Airport July 24, while attempting to board a flight to Pakistan. For more than a decade the congressional staffer had worked under top House Democrats, and he had just been accused by the FBI of bank fraud. It was a dramatic moment in a saga that started in February, when Capitol Police confirmed an investigation into Mr. Awan and his family on separate accusations of government theft. The details are tantalizing: The family all worked for top Democrats, were paid huge sums, and had access to sensitive congressional data, even while having ties to Pakistan. Even if this never adds up to a spy thriller, it outranks most of the media’s other obsessions.  The media largely has ignored the affair, the ho-hum coverage summed up by a New York Times piece suggesting it may be nothing more than an “overblown Washington story, typical of midsummer.” But even without evidence of espionage or blackmail, this ought to be an enormous scandal. Because based on what we already know, the Awan story is—at the very least—a tale of massive government incompetence that seemingly allowed a family of accused swindlers to bilk federal taxpayers out of millions and even put national secrets at risk.

But that wasn’t the case on Tuesday. The Times ran an epic disaster of a news story, claiming that “scientists say they fear the Trump administration could change or suppress” a draft report on climate change produced by scientists from 13 federal agencies that “directly contradicts claims by President Trump and members of his cabinet who say that the human contribution to climate change is uncertain.” The article was in the top spot of the front page, in the upper-right-hand corner with three sets of headlines, stacked on top of one another. You could almost imagine Times staffers high-fiving as they wrote each word – another Resistance victory! My favorite phrase was “fears of suppression.” That referenced the paranoia of anti-Trump forces in the administration. “One government scientist who worked on the report, and who spoke to The Times on the condition of anonymity, said he and others were concerned that it would be suppressed,” wrote climate change stenographer Lisa Friedman. The whole premise of the story was that this report was leaked to The Times out of fear that evil President Trump would hide it. Except the report has been available online since January. The basic premise of the entire story of “suppression” was laughably wrong. Seven months worth of wrong. The paper added a lame correction the next day with a deer-in-the-headlights surprise that it had somehow been inaccurate. Washington Post media writer Erik Wemple gutted The Times for the “screw-up” and its gross incompetence: “That correction, which sits at the foot of the story, dutifully straightens out the record. Yet given the magnitude of the screw-up, it should sit atop the story, surrounded by red flashing lights and perhaps an audio track to instruct readers: Warning: This story once peddled a faulty and damaging premise,” he wrote. Imagine if a conservative outlet had published something this horrendously wrong. The journalism community would scream “Fake news!” and claim that outlet was irresponsible. But when it’s one of news organizations journalists love, all will soon be forgiven. Until the next time. Which takes us to the rest of what was horrible this week: 2. Google Doesn’t Believe In Freedom: Google the phrase, “Google doesn't believe in freedom,” and you should see stories about its former employee James Damore. Damore is one of those windmill tilters who would have made Don Quixote proud. Damore worked for Google as an engineer. Until this week. Damore made the mistake of writing up a big memo about the flaws in Google’s diversity initiatives, but stressed he was pro-diversity. “I strongly believe in gender and racial diversity, and I think we should strive for more. However, to achieve a more equal gender and race representation, Google has created several discriminatory practices,” he wrote. Liberals were triggered and Google fired Damore, creating a firestorm as Social Justice Warriors gathered Twitter mobs to destroy Damore. Journalists repeatedly misrepresented what he wrote, eager to crush people who challenged someone “Game of Thrones” fans might call the Great Sept of Diversity. One New York Times writer called what Damore wrote the “sexist/racist writings like the Google memo.” No bias there, never! CNN misrepresented the memo and called it an “anti-diversity manifesto.” That’s the tag team of irresponsibility – claiming it’s anti-diversity when Damore said he’s not and then titling it a “manifesto,” just like the Unabomber. The “anti-diversity” phrasing was common – from CNBC to Fortune and even Reuters. Journalists love diversity. Until you tell them, as Damore did, it should include diversity of opinions. Conservatives who are used to mistrusting major media outlets should add Google to that list of businesses that embrace the liberal agenda as doctrine. Before we’re all marched down some internet street as the mob shouts, “Shame!” 3. CNN Purges Pro-Trump Jeffrey Lord: Firing people for their politics is all the rage. CNN dropped pro-Trump commentator Jeffrey Lord after Lord had a testy exchange with a lefty activist on Twitter, ending the exchange by mockingly tweeting, “Sieg Heil!” Lord (who writes occasionally for Newsbusters, where I work) pointed out that there’s an obvious left-wing campaign against Fox News. After a testy exchange, he posted a link to a column calling that campaign “fascist.” Lord’s piece stressed: “This is America … Not Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany or Communist Russia.” Unfortunately, lefty activists keep trying to reset the GPS. 4. Media’s Explosive North Korea Rhetoric: The news media’s anti-Trump default has put them in strange company this week – sympathizing with nuclear-armed North Korean nut job Kim Jong Un. Kim is the latest canker on the North Korean body politic, leading a nation of roughly 25 million that is a mix of bizarre death cult and medieval concentration camp. Hardly the guy sane people seek as an ally. But Trump’s strong words against Kim have caused the media to stand up … to Trump. Repeatedly. CBS turned to former Clinton aide Jake Sullivan to bash Trump and then let him get away with it. “It just doesn't help when our allies and the countries in the region can’t tell whether it's Donald Trump or Kim Jong Un who's the crazier one,” said Sullivan. CBS staff? Crickets. MSNBC called Trump’s response to North Korea’s continued threats of nuclear attack, “a far more stark, a far more inflammatory, a far more dangerous red line.” The networks reliably turned to Republicans who would speak out against Trump, and polls that undercut him amidst a dangerous crisis. 5. Guess What’s Left Out Of All The Gore Coverage?: With all the coverage of former Vice President Al Gore, it’s almost like he has his own TV network. Oops, he tried that once, before selling it to the oil nation of Qatar while telling all of us that oil money is dirty. But there’s one story getting little attention at all. Gore bought carbon offsets for his first film 11 years ago, some of which have gone toward … absolutely nothing. All of the carbon from “An Inconvenient Truth” was “offset” for the Owl Feather War Bonnet Wind Farm on the Rosebud Sioux Reservation in South Dakota. Those offsets cost all of $1,000 out of Al’s mighty war chest. Eleven years later, Gore is still using the same carbon offset company and the wind farm still isn’t built. Rather than focus on how silly carbon offsets are, the media just continue to talk Gore. They tried and failed to help his sequel break into the top 10 movies. But Gore-adoring journos are unlikely to start poking into things that embarrass him – like talking about how he flies more than many jet pilots and tells us all that fossil fuels are bad. How come journalists won’t ask the guy involved in creating the internet why he never heard of Skype or telecommuting? 6. Hollywood Hates Conservatives This Much: It’s not even fall TV season. All we have now is the summer filler schedule and it’s filled alright – with vicious attacks on people the networks consider evil – conservatives or Republicans. It’s like conservatives are the ordinary soldiers lined up to fight Daenerys Targaryen, waiting to be barbecued by her pet dragon. Go get a group together and ask them, if you have a dustpan and brush. Here are just a few highlights from one week of summer TV. Again, this is just one week. Hulu’s “Difficult People” called Vice President Mike Pence a “failed prototype for one of those Japanese sex robots” and presented the new seal of his office as a swastika. That pales by comparison to Netflix’s “Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,” which depicted both President Ronald Reagan and VP George H.W. Bush defecating graphically on an architectural model Reagan didn’t like. (Doubt me? Here’s video.) A character in FX’s “Snowfall” even casually threw darts at a large picture of President Ronald Reagan. Think Hollywood hates Republicans? Just a little bit? There’s lots more, of course, that’s not all political. “Every couple should have a threesome,” proclaimed one character after a third-anniversary three-way tryst (“The Carmichael Show” – NBC); a priest having an affair with a married woman (“People of Earth” – TBS); and complaints that Indianapolis Colts bosses donate to \"right-wing f**ks,\"  (Ballers –HBO). Actor/activist James Cromwell told The Daily Mail that Hollywood needs to become more activist. “This community’s got to get more political,” he argued. One wonders how that would even be possible.

articles[24] = " \n                                     \n                                 House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), is perhaps the most powerful representative the Democrats have. When she speaks, it means something. And what she’s been speaking about lately is that others shouldn’t be speaking at all. That’s frightening. One might expect extremists in her party to have trouble with the First Amendment, but it’s alarming that the top Democrat in the House jumps on the bandwagon. Is this how most Democrats feel? The National Park Service recently announced that a right-wing rally by the group Patriot Prayer can go forward Saturday at federally owned Crissy Field in San Francisco, near the Golden Gate Bridge. Pelosi calls members of the group white supremacists (though they say they support peace, love and unity). While the group is controversial, the right of its members to speak shouldn’t be. But it sure is to Pelosi, whose grip on the First Amendment appears a bit shaky. This is from her statement on the National Park Service decision: “In San Francisco, we have great reverence for the Constitutional right to dissent and peaceful free speech,” Pelosi said. “However, free speech does not grant the right to yell fire in a crowded theater, incite violence or endanger the public in any venue. As we ponder where and by whom the ill-conceived decision to approve this permit in a national park was made, we must all pray it does not become an invitation to incite violence.” Pelosi reveres the “right to dissent and peaceful free speech?” Then the rally shouldn’t trouble her. Patriot Prayer wants to present a different viewpoint, and the permit allows members to hold a peaceful rally to express their beliefs, not to loot and pillage. Then Pelosi pulls out the old chestnut about yelling fire in a crowded theatre. She’s paraphrasing U.S. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes’ famous line about “falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic.” Holmes actually described a very limited exception to the First Amendment, but that doesn’t stop every would-be censor from pulling it out. In fact, so many have misused the Holmes statement, and so often, that I’m guessing if he were around today he’d regret he ever wrote it. Perhaps the most troubling part of Pelosi’s response is that she worries the rally will become an “invitation to incite violence.” What does that mean? If members of Patriot Prayer commit violence, they should be held responsible and prosecuted. But if groups opposing Patriot Prayer – and a number have promised to show up – don’t like what they hear and attack the rally, then they are responsible for their own violence. Pelosi shouldn’t be afraid to say that, but based on her phrasing, it almost sounds like the opposition could claim “it’s not our fault, they incited us.” Discussing this issue on TV recently, Pelosi said “the Constitution does not say that a person can yell wolf in a crowded theatre.” I can forgive her for the gaffe. In fact, she may be right – falsely yelling “wolf!” in a crowded theatre might cause a panic as much as shouting “fire!” What I can’t forgive her for is the sentiment behind it. It makes her a wolf in sheep’s clothing, claiming to protect the safety of the public, when all she’ll do is rip up the Constitution.

articles[25] = " \n                                     \n                                 Poor Hillary. Big, bad Donald Trump got so close to her during the presidential debate last fall, she says, that he “made her skin crawl.” “Morning Joe” broadcast a recording of Mrs. Clinton reading that revealing snippet aloud yesterday, her plain, hard intonations trying to excite interest in “What Happened?” her new book purporting to explain why she lost the election. The passage, which recounts her musing about how she should react to his looming presence, evokes several responses. Number one: if that’s the best tease they could find in this unnecessary oeuvre (don’t we all know why she lost?), I hope Simon & Schuster has a sure-fire way to get their advance back. The company is deep in the hole after publishing her last tome, “Hard Choices,” which sold only some 280,000 copies in its first year. For that one they reportedly ponied up an advance of $14 million; whatever they paid for this one, it was probably too much. By the way, that sales total for “Hard Choices,” a stunningly dull work, doesn’t come close to the million-plus copies sold of Trump’s “Art of the Deal;” one more round to Trump.  Number two: her recollection may be faulty. Hillary’s memory often plays tricks on her, like when she mistakenly remembered having come under sniper fire in Bosnia, or when she blamed the Benghazi attack on a video, or when she said that all her grandparents had immigrated to the U.S. (Three of four were born in this country.) The morning after the debate in question, then-candidate Trump, accused of having tried to intimidate her, denied the charge, and claimed that it was Clinton who invaded his space. The video shown on Morning Joe shows Trump standing at some distance from Hillary, not breathing down her neck, contrary to her description of the scene. He patiently waits at his lectern while she speaks. What is the truth? Number three: in the book, she says that at the time, feeling uncomfortable, she wished she could “hit pause, and say to everyone watching, well, what would you do?” That is so extraordinarily revealing. Hillary Clinton, at that moment, feeling pressured by her rival and uncertain how to respond, actually wants to take a survey. She doesn’t trust her own instincts, so turns to crowd-sourcing for answers. Maybe this book is more telling than we had imagined because, indeed, that is exactly one of the reasons Clinton lost. Remember early in the campaign when the New York Times wrote an admiring story about Hillary’s intense preparation? How she had consulted no less than 47 experts in preparing her economic agenda? I thought at the time: anyone nearing 70 and readying to run for president must surely know what she believes. But no, she was lost, and still exploring every point of view. The result was a platform-by-committee, a mishmash of policies directed by pollsters and political apparatchiks. You may not agree with Donald Trump’s views or agenda, but by gosh you know what he stood for. Trump promised to Make America Great Again by bringing back jobs, enforcing the rule of law, protecting our borders, demanding fair trade and turning back the Obama-era regulatory blitz. He vowed to put America First. Hillary’s campaign themes were buried under a mudslide of political talking points. One of John Podesta’s leaked emails revealed that Clinton's campaign weighed and ultimately rejected 84 potential slogans before choosing \"Stronger Together,\" a catchphrase that never gained traction. 84! Doesn’t that say it all? Number four: if Hillary is so easily intimidated by powerful men, she really does not belong in the Oval Office. She says in her book that in motoring through that “incredibly difficult moment” she was “aided by a lifetime of dealing with difficult men trying to throw me off.” One wonders, has she always struggled to assert herself with men? Was husband Bill one of those “difficult men?” Maybe her infamous “reset” with Vladimir Putin would have been more successful except that she was cowed by yet another “difficult” man displaying an excess of testosterone. Maybe Hillary is insecure around men because they are bigger than she is. In the video of the debate, Trump appears to be standing virtually on top of Mrs. Clinton, because he is taller. When the camera backs away, it is clear that there are several feet separating the two figures. President Trump stands 6’2”; that kind of height can be imposing or even intimidating to someone several inches shorter. Mrs. Clinton may be one of those people. In the 2008 campaign, her office told reporters that she was 5’5”. In the recent campaign, according to a piece in the Washington Post, her staff claimed she stood 5’7”. That’s remarkable, since she is of an age where she almost certainly is losing height, and not gaining it. Why would someone lie about their height? Does pretending to be taller give her extra confidence? For the record, Maggie Thatcher was 5’5”, as is Angela Merkel. Neither seems to have been intimidated by big, powerful men, including, in the case of Merkel, Donald Trump. Could it be that Hillary simply doesn’t have what it takes to be president? That’s what voters decided. Maybe, at the end, that’s What Happened.  Liz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNews.com.

The leftwing reporters, editors, producers, television personalities, and analysts all find it exciting to watch Republicans try to damage each other. If a moderate Republican attacks a traditional, more conservative Republican, the former is often lionized as a heroic figure for putting citizenship above partisanship. Conservatives attacking other Republicans may not be applauded like moderates, but they are guaranteed to receive maximum coverage for their party cannibalism. So if you are a relatively unknown Republican, with a small online following, you can easily increase your name recognition by simply instigating attacks on other Republicans. Conservatives attacking other Republicans may not be applauded like moderates, but they are guaranteed to receive maximum coverage for their party cannibalism.  While the Republicans who call themselves “Never Trumpers” have gained the most attention for their intraparty attacks, there is also an equal – if not larger – group of “Never Ryan” and “Never McConnell” Republicans. All of this behavior is crazy. When there is a limited amount of time and energy, the rational strategy is to use it to attack your opponents. The real opponents of conservative goals are liberal Democrats. Yet the current conservative anger (including the president's anger) is targeted at Republicans, rather than Democrats. Take, for example, the anger over the Senate’s failure to repeal ObamaCare. Three Republicans and 48 Democrats voted no. That’s 16 Democratic “no” votes for every Republican “no.” Yet when the bill ultimately failed by one vote, it was not the dozens of Democrats who were held up as the problem, it was the three Republicans. It is very unlikely that attacking these three Republicans will cause them to change their minds. None of the three Senators in question are vulnerable to pressure. On the other hand, there are TEN Democratic Senators up for reelection in states President Trump carried in 2016. Every one of these ten Senators is vulnerable to an all-out campaign to explain to their constituents how much they are part of the swamp and how obstructionist and negative they have been. The tax cut bill and the infrastructure bill will offer new powerful opportunities to organize the grassroots to bring pressure to bear on these Democratic Senators. Voting no against President Trump’s agenda can be turned into voting no against the pocketbooks of their own constituents. Similarly, despite all the frustration expressed about Speaker Ryan and Senate Leader McConnell, they are not the enemies of the president's agenda. They may, at times, fall short of the desired legislative majority, but they are working their hearts out to try to get tax cuts, health reform, and other conservative legislation. The two leaders doing everything they can to stop President Trump's agenda are Minority Leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. In Schumer's case, his opposition has included a historic level of obstruction, delay, and stonewalling of President Trump's appointees. It is scandalous how many key positions in the executive branch remain vacant (many of which are currently being occupied by Obama holdovers). This is part of a deliberate strategy of \"resistance\" by Schumer and the Democrats – which, of course, means they are resisting the will of the American people as expressed in the election. Yet because Republicans and conservative activists have been so busy complaining about other Republicans, the Democrats have paid virtually no price for crippling the American government with their obstructionist tactics. If conservative activists and Republicans would focus their attacks on Democrats, then 2018 could become a very good year. With the right grassroots campaign starting this fall, the ten Trump state Democrats would be forced to choose between giving Republicans the votes needed to pass the Trump agenda or being repudiated back home. Either way, the Trump agenda gets passed, either before next November or in 2019, after the vulnerable Democrats lose their elections. So remember, whenever you hear a conservative activist or a Republican complain about a Republican, ask them how much time they have spent that day complaining about the Democrats who are the real opponents of their program and their values.

He had just come back from his fourth combat deployment.  Upon his return, he learned that his wife was leaving him.  As he was discussing that sad development, he suddenly screamed at the top of his lungs: “My three year-old daughter won’t give me a hug.  She doesn’t know me. She thinks I’m a stranger.” Quagmire is too tame a word to describe the life and money-swallowing swamp that is Afghanistan. He had sought me out simply to vent.  He needed to talk to someone and was too fearful of getting professional or military counseling as he was worried it would negatively affect his career. A career, he stressed, which was all that he had left after losing his family to “needless and political deployments.” As President Trump committed our nation to an open-ended timetable in Afghanistan, I thought continuously about that heroic soldier and both the personal sacrifices he made as well as the ultimate sacrifices made by his comrades. Were they for nothing?  Were they in vain?  Is Afghanistan a bottomless abyss of corruption, loss and hopelessness? Both in writing and in conversation, I have made no secret of my overall admiration for President Trump.  I became a fan of his thirty years ago when I worked in the Reagan White House and truly do believe he is the breath of fresh air needed to rid Washington, D.C. of the stench of cronyism and depravity which oozes through the hallways of power. That said, as one who has long believed that the United States has been played for a sucker by other nations into becoming the police force of the world – to the tune of trillions of American tax dollars wasted and the priceless loss of thousands of American service members – I was thrilled to hear then-candidate Trump intimate that we would be getting out of Afghanistan and redirecting those financial resources back into the “crumbling infrastructure” of our own nation. The president’s admitted reversal of his own thinking certainly gave me pause. During his nationally televised speech recommitting our nation to combat in Afghanistan, President Trump made a crucial and much needed point: that as “President Trump” you see the world and its problems in a much different and harsher light than when you were “Candidate Trump.” Now as Commander-in-Chief, President Trump is privy to daily top secret intelligence and military briefings.  Briefings neither he nor any other candidate were allowed to see while on the campaign trail. More than that, he now has three generals advising him daily with regard to his options in Afghanistan and elsewhere in an increasingly worrisome and unpredictable world.   Those three generals are his Chief of Staff John Kelly, his national security advisor H. R. McMaster, and Secretary of Defense James Mattis. Three generals who advised the president to recommit to Afghanistan. Men, who like the president, have access to top secret intelligence briefings and assessments which the rest of us will never see. I acknowledge the value in such access and do believe that “Heavy is the head that wears the crown.” That said, President Trump and his generals could still be wrong.  For a combined 26 years, the former Soviet Union and our nation have not been able to crack the code for victory.  What is really different now? Quagmire is too tame a word to describe the life and money-swallowing swamp that is Afghanistan. While I still oppose the United States remaining in Afghanistan, I do believe President Trump deserves the benefit of the doubt.  He and his military advisors stressed they have finally come up with a winning strategy, and it will soon be obvious if that is the case. As this latest campaign begins, I will remember the Special Forces Sergeant who broke down in my living room. He, his colleagues, and the families who lost a loved one in Afghanistan deserve closure. Our nation owes them all a debt which may never be repaid, but at least closure is a down payment.

articles[28] = " \n                                     \n                                 Despite record job growth, the Dow over 22,000, illegal immigration down 70 percent and massive deregulation, the mainstream media still reports that Donald Trump’s presidency is a failure. To put the final nail in the coffin of the opposition (Republicans, Democrats and the failing mainstream media) President Trump needs victories in three areas: legislative, the court of public opinion, and national defense and diplomacy. First, legislative – more specifically, health care. A handful of Republicans – after campaigning, raising money on and promising the repeal of ObamaCare – failed to deliver. This is why “we the people” like the president more than Congress. But it is not too late for Trump to post a victory here. He can propose a bill to repeal only the individual mandate and he needs to do it louder than anything else he has done to date. That is the single most unpopular element of the health care law and might even garner support from across the aisle – even Democrats have admitted it needs changes. This would be very hard to vote against and the president would post his first legislative victory. And for those Republicans who vote against this? Find and support primary opponents against them in their districts, and campaign hard for them. Send the message. Get on board the Trump Train or get run over. Also in the legislative column: tax reform. What legislator would not want to go home to constituents and be able to say “we put more money in your paycheck?” Here is how you roll it out: send Sarah Huckabee Sanders to the podium with an average middle class American making $50-60,000 a year, hold up his current paycheck, what he makes and what he takes home. Then you hold up a second paycheck with the same salary under Trump’s tax plan highlighting the difference in the take home pay. “This is what President Trump stands for. Congress, the bill is on your desk, make it happen.” She walks out without taking any questions and does not hold a press conference until Congress votes on it. This will allow the White House to go on the offense. It is now Congress’ fault that the White House is not taking questions and the media will naturally turn its sights to the Republicans in Congress for not helping the middle class American, forcing their hand. During this time, Trump, like he did against Hillary and her days since her last press conference, counts the days on Twitter. Boom, second legislative victory in his first year. In the court of public opinion, Trump has been convicted by the mainstream media of Russian collusion. The problem, though, is they have yet to produce any evidence for any of their criminal allegations. Here’s the play: Trump challenges his largest critics on this. Calling out Schumer, Pelosi, Waters and a few more saying that he will participate in the investigation to the fullest for 90 more days on the condition that if nothing is found, they resign their seats. Look, there is no precedent or legal grounds for this. If they don’t respond in 10 days, he fires Special Counsel Robert Mueller. It’s simply a PR play, they will NOT agree to this which gives Trump the opportunity to go on the offense and say, “The Democrats don’t even believe in this investigation.” Finally, national defense. Even with the 15-0 global decision against it at the UN Security Council, North Korea is going to continue to push the envelope until we do something. Sanctions will not work and will only further enrage the regime. North Korea is so poor that people are eating the frogs and bugs in the streets – any sanctions placed on them simply re-directs any limited funds away from his people and back to his military complex. We have a military machine unlike anyone else. Time to use it! Park three carrier groups off the coast. When North Korea launches another missile, we will assume – due to recent threats – that it is not a test and will shoot it down. When they fire another one we shoot that down and destroy the installation that it came from. Then shoot the next one down and destroy three more military establishments. During this time, the president needs to use his PR machine at the White House to continue to encourage Kim Jung Un to come to the table. Put the ball in his court, get him to the table. President Trump is a different type of politician. He made his mark by doing things aggressively and thinking outside the box. I encourage him to stay the course. Mr. President, do what you do best, run over your opponents and don’t look back. As Eric Trump said recently, “The Left would rather see our country fail than Trump succeed.” That is the nature of the opposition. With newly assigned General Kelly at the helm, I have no doubt that this administration is being steered back to the right course.

There’s much more that conservatives like about the job President Trump is doing.  When it comes to sanctuary city reform and border security, President Trump’s leadership has exceeded all expectations.  In fact, President Trump has been so effective in dealing with sanctuary city lawlessness that elitist liberal Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is suing the Trump Administration to try and keep Chicago a dangerous sanctuary city.    I could go on and on, but one thing is clear:  President Trump is an outsider and a change agent and conservatives are elated that President Trump wakes up in the morning to fight the failed status quo in Washington and the biased mainstream news media that only does the bidding of out-of-touch liberals in New York and San Francisco.  No one knows this better than Vice President Mike Pence.  Since becoming President Trump’s running mate a little over a year ago, Vice President Pence has been a full partner with the president in their mission to enact their conservative reform agenda and “Make America Great Again.”  The vice president is focused like a laser beam on fixing health care, tax reform, and various other initiatives and is doing a great job.  When Vice President Pence travels to Iowa or Ohio to advocate for the president’s agenda it means exactly that and nothing more.  President Trump and Vice President Pence are looking forward to defeating Congresswoman Maxine Waters or whatever leftist the out-of-control Democrat Party nominates in 2020. Also mentioned in some of these disingenuous “news” stories has been career politician John Kasich.  Ohio Governor Kasich ran for president in 2000 and 2016.  In 2000, he didn’t make it to the primaries and in 2016 he won only his home state of Ohio.  President Trump carried Ohio and other Rust Belt states during the general election because his outsider message connected with millions of voters in a way Kasich could not, largely because he was a longtime Washington politician.    President Trump has been in office for only 200 days and yet the mainstream media is already trying to start the 2020 campaign for president.  Are there really Americans out there itching to start watching coverage of the 2020 race even before the 2018 midterms take place? Or is it just because contentious presidential elections are the only thing that sells failing newspapers anymore?  I submit that most reasonable hardworking American taxpayers want to give their president a chance to succeed because if his agenda is enacted, people’s lives will improve.   David N.

articles[30] = " \n                                     \n                                 As the Left have attempted to stake their claim as the only group who represents and cares about women, they have also managed to simultaneously stab these same women in the back, betraying the very essence of their femininity and steamrolling over the uniqueness of the sexes in order to elevate their own agendas. The debate over the role of transgendered individuals (people who identify as one gender but have the anatomy of another), has risen again in recent weeks, with President Trump's declaration that transgendered individuals will no longer be able to serve in the military. It will no doubt continue to be a hot debate as the culture wars rage on. The issue of gender dysphoria is real and painful and we must have love and compassion for them.  But I fear they are being politically and monetarily used as the Left, always looking for a new group to exploit, opens new fronts in the culture wars.  Feminists should wonder, however, that if we reconstruct male and female to sixty-three and growing definitions, who is protected and who is hurt? Does this new idea of no binary definition of gender displace and demean the hard fought and won accomplishments of women?   Consider the issue of women's sports. When men are allowed to compete as women, women lose no matter how hard they work. I think yes. Consider the issue of women's sports. When men are allowed to compete as women, women lose no matter how hard they work. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 was crafted to ensure that female athletes were not left out of sports and created a level playing field which encouraged excellence in competition. Congress and feminists understood that boys and girls are physiologically different and that boys vs. boys and girls v. girls was fair because of basic biological and hormonal differences. Title IX has nothing to do with character, power, or intelligence. Fast forward to 2016, when a boy identifying as a girl qualified for the Alaska State Championships in the 200-meter dash, displacing a female athlete for third place. The senior competed against girls as young as freshmen. Hardly fair. In June of this year, a boy identifying as a girl was allowed to compete on the female high school track team in Connecticut and was lauded for placing first in two races. His time would have placed him last in the same races in the boys division. Colleges offer sports scholarships for both genders based on high school accomplishments. But now, these scholarships have the potential to be monopolized by boys in both male and female categories. Last month, it was announced that for the first time since all combat roles were opened to women in December of 2015, there are two female candidates in the Navy SEAL and Special Warfare Combatant-Craft Crewman program (SWCC) programs. This watershed moment for women in the military has the merit to stand alone, but instead, the news story went on to undercut the success of these two women by saying that, in fact, the first woman to join an elite Navy force could be a transgender woman who came out in 2016. Sports titles have been stripped from women, and military achievements by women are being given to men, but surely women can maintain their right to privacy and their respect as child-bearers, right? Wrong. The women’s bathroom is no longer a secure place for women and children to go for privacy. Security is not so narrow as to imply only physical safety, it also encompasses emotional safety. The women’s bathroom is a place where women are vulnerable. To have a man present, no matter his self-perception, compromises that vulnerability. Talk about a need for safe spaces. As if this is not enough, the Huffington Post highlighted a transgender individual holding a sign that read, “Periods are not just for women” while flaunting blood-stained pants between spread legs. If not so horrifying and disrespectful, it would be comical. Of course, periods are just for women and most of us have more dignity than to flaunt them for a political stunt. By using a woman’s menstrual cycle, which indicates her unique role as a foundational creator and nurturer of life, these activists betray women and use her for cheap political props. This is an attack on a woman’s amazing biological ability to bear and give birth to children. This is gender appropriation – stealing something precious that distinctly belongs to women, demeaning it, and distorting its purpose. Historically, women have fought to defend and protect their position and authority within society. Our spaces and institutions have value and therefore deserve respect and protection from encroachment of the entitled Left.  The emperor has no clothes and our pretending otherwise only degrades women.   Penny Young Nance is president and CEO of Concerned Women for America, the nation’s largest women’s public policy organization.

articles[31] = " \n                                     \n                                 House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi appeared Sunday on Fox News to defend herself and the Democratic Party’s new initiative – dubbed A Better Deal – aimed at rebuilding her party’s standing with the nation’s voters. Pelosi’s pitch was straightforward: our economy is rigged against America’s workers and only Democrats can fix it. One small problem: America has heard this before. On countless commercials. In numerous debates. For months on end. As highlighted by even supportive media outlets, A Better Deal is largely a rehash of solutions offered by Hillary Clinton during her failed presidential campaign. That doesn’t mean A Better Deal is without merit, as Fox’s Chris Wallace noted. But clearly something was missing when Clinton made these same losing arguments. The American people were looking for something more. Something different. And that underlines why Pelosi’s performance was another train wreck for Democrats. D.C. Democrats still don’t understand – or won’t accept – why they keep losing.  President Trump reached the White House with a simple promise: Make America Great Again. He saw a broken immigration system, gutted manufacturing base, and a set of toothless foreign policies that all originated from feckless and corrupt D.C. elites. To right the ship, Trump vowed to drain the swamp of America’s political losers and push through an agenda that would leave the country literally tired of winning. Said differently, Trump focused on the brokenness of Washington D.C. It was a smart strategy. For years, Congress’ approval rating has been dismal. America has grown tired of the constant political warfare between dueling politicians that has resulted in little progress. Poll after poll also shows that voters are disgusted by a political system that all too often leads to career politicians who drink off the corrupting spigot of campaign cash from corporate interests. Bottom line: America wanted better leadership and an effective government in 2016. Fair or not, Trump became the credible voice to accomplish those goals. Six months later, it’s debatable whether Trump is the voice that America wanted. However what isn’t up for debate is that the country still desires better leadership. In fact, polls show that we view it as the most pressing issue facing the nation. More important than health care. More than the economy. More than immigration. And yet despite the country’s hunger for fresh leadership, Democratic leaders like Nancy Pelosi (with 29 years in office) continue to appear on TV to promote the party’s reboot. Complete with Clinton’s losing proposals. To underline the absurdity, Pelosi made it clear that the new initiative is “not a course correction, but a presentation correction.” In other words, same politicians and same message, just a prettier bow. If the whole enterprise smacks of ego, it should. Pelosi knows that Americans want new leadership and a functional national government. She knows that this requires her to step aside for the good of the party and country. However she’s made it clear that she’s not going anywhere. To the point, when Pelosi was asked about the importance of a fresh start for the party, she responded, “I don’t think people want a new direction.” When asked whether she would withdraw for a new generation of leaders, she refused. “I am a master legislator,” Pelosi said. D.C. Democrats have thus placed the party in an intractable position: they have leaders who lack the credible voice to move the party forward, yet the leaders refuse to leave. For those Democrats outside the Beltway, this conundrum leaves them with two uncomfortable options: Accept the status quo, or fight back. The status quo is clearly unacceptable. Democrats have the fewest number of elected officials at the state and national level since the 1920s. Sixty-seven percent of Americans view the party as out of touch. That leaves rebellion. An effective political coup requires concerned governors, legislators, and Democratic voters to publicly reject their current leadership. If Pelosi and others like her won’t step down, the rebels must make it clear to America’s voters that the D.C. Democrats do not speak for them.  Meanwhile, a successful rebellion must offer an agenda that demonstrates that Democrats have heard America’s demand for new, effective leadership. Indeed, the rebels must embrace the only proven ways to eject career politicians from their perches of power and money: term limits and a lifetime ban on elected officials from lobbying. For years, an overwhelming majority of Americans have demanded passage of these two initiatives. Voters understand that if politicians aren’t chasing corporate cash for reelection or a lucrative retirement, they are more likely to do the business of the American people. Consider the issue of prescription drug prices, highlighted as a part of A Better Deal. When the U.S. Senate recently considered legislation that would have allowed Americans to import cheap prescription drugs from Canada, 14 Democratic senators rejected it (along with most Republicans). Not surprisingly, many of these politicians have collected large sums of campaign cash from pharmaceutical giants. To point out the obvious, this is the broken system that helped put Trump in the White House. And that begs the question: would the president join a Democratic rebellion in a push for term limits and a ban on lobbying? After all, he recently upgraded his “drain the swamp” mantra to “drain the sewer.” If President Trump declines, then the rebels could fold the idea into a new covenant with the American people. Call it Our American Oath. Shortly after Donald Trump was elected, a group of sensible Americans and I drafted a series of 10 policy directives designed to help move the country forward. From term limits to the economy and the War on Terror, we hammered out agreements that reflect Democratic values while working to find common ground with Republicans. No matter the covenant’s particulars, it’s time for a national rebellion of concerned Democrats. Officials like Pelosi have become unresponsive and tone deaf, pushing failed schemes like “A Better Deal” when what American voters want is better leadership.  It’s time that Democrats give voters what they deserve.

articles[32] = " \n                                     \n                                 Will President Trump fire or demand the resignation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, after repeatedly attacking Sessions on Twitter and in statements and interviews? Let’s hope not, because Sessions is doing an outstanding job to fight crime and make America safer.  President Trump has repeatedly made clear his frustration and disappointment with Sessions for recusing himself from oversight of Justice Department investigations into allegations that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 race for the White House. But Sessions told Fox News’ Tucker Carlson Thursday that he “made the right decision” in recusing himself from the FBI’s Russia investigation because of his role in the Trump presidential campaign. And Sessions said he has no intention of resigning, though he understands he serves at the pleasure of the president and that President Trump has the right to replace him.    One can understand President Trump’s growing frustration with the seemingly endless and ever-expanding Russia investigations. The president has said he would not have appointed Sessions as attorney general if he had known Sessions would recuse himself from the Russia investigation. There is a genuine feeling among the men and women in blue that,  for the first time in eight years, the president and attorney general have their backs. One can even see why President Trump would question why the investigations encircling him continue to widen, while those against Hillary Clinton have faded into the woodwork. But dismissing Sessions as attorney general would be a giant step in the wrong direction. Because, although he has been missing from the Russia battle, Sessions has been highly engaged – to significant benefit – in perhaps even more important areas. It’s hard to overstate the problems Sessions inherited after two successive attorneys general turned the Department of Justice into a political arm of the Obama administration. Through its “blame first, ask questions later” posture of hostility to the police – in Ferguson, Mo.; Baton Rouge, La.; Dallas and elsewhere –  the federal government under President Obama had lost the trust of its partners in local law enforcement. A survey of nearly 3,400 law enforcement officers on their attitudes in the post-Ferguson/Dallas/Baton Rouge world of attacks on police confirmed anecdotal evidence in two areas – it found officers had begun to disengage in proactive policing and felt under attack in a way they hadn’t before. This isn’t just a problem for police morale – it’s a problem for us all, because when police fear prosecution for doing their jobs they sometimes do less, giving dangerous criminals greater freedom to everyone else. Like all citizens, law enforcement officers should be presumed innocent until proven guilty. But under the Obama administration, when questions arose about police conduct officers too often were presumed guilty until proven innocent.      Nearly half of the officers in the survey said they had made fewer traffic and pedestrian stops since Ferguson. More than half said their enjoyment at work had decreased. They were confident in their training on when to use force, but 40 percent said they had become more reluctant to do so. And it is hard to blame them. In 2016, 20 officers nationwide were killed in ambush attacks – the most in a year since 1995. There have been ambushes in Philadelphia, Boston, New York City and elsewhere.  But since Sessions took over, things have begun to improve. There is a genuine feeling among the men and women in blue that, for the first time in eight years, the president and attorney general have their backs. The Obama Justice Department had a practice of suing police departments for alleged civil rights violations. It investigated 25 police departments and sheriff’s offices around the country and was enforcing court-ordered agreements in 2016 to resolve civil rights lawsuits against 19 cities, including Ferguson, Baltimore, New Orleans and Cleveland. Sessions began rebuilding police trust by pumping the brakes. “We need, so far as we can, to help police departments get better, not diminish their effectiveness,” he said. “And I’m afraid we’ve done some of that.” Sessions also has called for a return to tougher sentencing. For example, he encouraged federal prosecutors to bring charges when drug crimes also involve guns, so criminals can be subject to the tougher sentencing in federal courts. Sessions is also considering increased prosecution of marijuana law violations, even in states that have legalized the drug. “I don’t think America will be a better place when more people, especially young people, smoke pot,” he said. In addition, Sessions is working with the Department of Homeland Security to crack down on illegal border crossings and is working with police chiefs across the country to fight the opioid crisis that is ravaging American cities and towns, taking the lives of over 50,000 Americans last year. Last week, Sessions took important steps to restore civil asset forfeitures, a critical tool that supports state and local law enforcement, and strengthens an array of federal policing task forces and programs. He understands the sacrifice and risk that law-enforcement officers face and knows violent crime is worsening after decades of decline and must be fought with renewed vigor. So, Mr. President, law enforcement understands your frustration. We’ve endured accusations we considered unfair as well. We know what it’s like to work among people who seem bent on our destruction. But please, before you dismiss General Sessions, or demand his resignation, reflect on the good he has done for American law enforcement and in advancing the right agenda in his brief tenure. If you do, I think you will agree that he is worth keeping on. His actions are keeping the American people safer and getting criminals off our streets.

Just like France. That was the case with the Boy Scouts, a group that has repeatedly caved to alt-left pressure. President Trump spoke to more than 40,000 Scouts, leaders and volunteers Tuesday at the National Scout Jamboree in West Virginia and the media and left went insane – comparing the Scouts to the Hitler Youth. Anyone who cheers this president gets thrown under the Panzer by liberals. On Thursday the Scout leadership bowed to the assault. \"I want to extend my sincere apologies to those in our Scouting family who were offended by the political rhetoric that was inserted into the jamboree,\" said Chief Scout Executive Michael Surbaugh. \"That was never our intent.\" President Trump’s speech caused a media firestorm because the president tying his shoes would cause a media firestorm. He was attacked by liberals, and both news and entertainment media. The New York Times headlined that “Late Show” host Stephen Colbert “Says Trump Attacked Boy Scouts’ “Belief in Our Democracy.” Colbert built his career on attacking conservatives and recently drew criticism for making an obscene reference to President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Compared to that, saying the Boy Scouts were like Hitler Youth was mild for the left. But liberals were angry that the Scouts cheered President Trump. So they compared them to Nazis. That sounds reasonable to no one except libs. Liberals have been calling Trump a Nazi since 2015 when he first began his race. One of the most obvious examples of that stupidity was ABC’s “The View” star Whoopi Goldberg. In response to Trump’s opposition to bringing Syrian refugees to the U.S., she compared the two and said: “Hitler was a Christian.” She also made a similar comparison to Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh. That was amateur hour compared to this week. Liberals call Trump Hitler or say he’s a Nazi at the drop of a hat. But liberals went from attacking Trump to attacking kids with the same ferocity. Here’s how Newsweek set the order of battle. “‘As the scout law says, a scout is trustworthy, loyal,’ Trump said, before adding, ‘We could use some more loyalty, I will tell you that.’ As he spoke, the crowd chanted ‘U.S.A’ and applauded.” Oh geez, they chanted “U.S.A” and applauded. The social media battle began. Twitter hashtags filled the space that sanity sometimes occupies. Terms like “#Hitler Youth” “#Hitler” and “#HitlersYouth” were flooded with comments from humans and bots. Far-left filmmaker Michael Moore cited a famous Nazi propaganda movie in his comparison: “I'm an Eagle Scout. Trump using the 30,000 BoyScouts as his props tonight was a scene out of Triumph of the Will. Shocking abuse of children.” John Haltiwanger, senior politics writer for the obscure Elite Daily (“The Voice Of Generation-Y™”) started making comparisons between President Trump and Hitler. Haltiwanger said both wanted loyalty and didn’t like the press. But he didn’t stop there: “Trump is not Hitler. Would be irresponsible to say they're the same. But he did make the Boy Scouts feel a lot like the Hitler Youth today,” he tweeted. Soap opera star Nancy Lee Grahn joined in. “Tragically, #boyscouts in 2017 applaud Trump just like the all blonde blue eyed youth did for Hitler in the 30's.” Medium ran a piece by S. Novi headlined: “Deranged Trump Emulates Hitler Youth Speech to Boy Scouts.” Igor Volsky, a vice president at the George Soros-funded Center for America Progress, was slightly more subtle. “Trump is trying to turn the Boy Scouts into Trump Youth,” he wrote. There were so many Nazi references running around on the left, it looked like Joseph Goebbels was running their media machine. Even the outlets commenting on the trend embraced their biases. “Of all of the outrageous and reprehensible things Trump has said and done over the past six months of his presidency, this seems to have really struck a raw nerve with people for a number of reasons,” wrote Uproxx. Buzzfeed focused on angry Scout leaders, who naturally made the “Hitler Youth” comparison. CNN Editor-at-large Chris Cillizza listed “the 29 most cringe-worthy lines from Donald Trump's hyper-political speech to the Boy Scouts.” But remember, CNN only thinks conservative media have opinions. The left has long hated the Boy Scouts, bullying the organization into accepting first gay scoutmasters and now pushing to let girls join the Boy Scouts. Because boys aren’t allowed to have any spaces where they can just be boys. And every organization must push a left-wing agenda, or be destroyed. Or surrender. And then be destroyed. The left is OK with either.  Dan Gainor is the Media Research Center's Vice President for Business and Culture. He writes frequently about media for Fox News Opinion.

articles[34] = " \n                                     \n                                  Watching news outlets go out of their way to hide a potentially huge Democratic scandal is almost funny. So-called journalists are too busy covering presidential tweets to report on a topic that might embarrass their friends. Welcome to the Imran Awan-Debbie Wasserman Schultz scandal or Compugrab, as I like to call it. Awan was the top IT aide to Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz. The FBI reportedly “seized smashed computer hard drives” from his home. He was “arrested trying to flee to Pakistan after wiring almost $300,000 to the country,” according to The Daily Caller, which has owned the story because it does actual news reporting. Here’s an amazing paragraph from the Caller: “Awan and members of his family received $4 million from the Democratic congressmen they were working for since 2010. Wasserman Schultz has been especially uncooperative with the probe into her staffers and even threatened the Capitol Police chief for gathering evidence. She refused to fire Awan until after he was arrested, even though Capitol Police had already revoked Awans’ access to the congressional IT system in February in relation to a major security breach.” ($4 million, and you wonder where your tax dollars go.) This is why so many Americans no longer trust the traditional media. It’s because we can’t. They’d rather write snarky stories about the president’s Twitter comments than do actual reporting.  The traditional media has barely even acknowledged this story exists. In the 24 hours after his arrest, only “CBS This Morning” reported on it – for 37 seconds. And co-host Gayle King made a point of ending the story with the claim by Awan’s attorney that charges are due to “anti-Muslim bigotry.” Newspapers have been almost as bad. The Washington Post wasn’t just slow to the party. Legal reporter Spencer Hsu didn’t mention Awan's ties to Hill Democrats until the seventh paragraph. Imagine the Post writing like that about Hill Republicans. A headline on an Associated Press story was especially entertaining: “Florida lawmaker fires IT staffer; Anti-Muslim bigotry is cause of client's arrest, lawyer says.” This is why so many Americans no longer trust the traditional media. It’s because we can’t. They’d rather write snarky stories about the president’s Twitter comments than do actual reporting. Hats off to The Daily Caller News Foundation’s Luke Rosiak for remembering what journalism really means. 2. Summertime For Hitler: President Trump’s speech to the Boy Scouts caused journalists and lefty media to have a Goebbels moment and envision the entire event as a Hitler Youth Rally. The alt-left marched in goose step comparing American boys to Nazis. Director Michael Moore, soap opera star Nancy Lee Grahn and other liberals pretended that chanting “U.S.A.” and cheering Trump made them equal to the people who supported Hitler. While “The View” didn’t “Sieg heil” like many on the left, it did bash Trump and put pressure on the Scouts. Among “The View’s” “Things Not to Say When Giving A Speech to 40,000 Boy Scouts” was this horrifying statement: “You will be saying Merry Christmas again when you go shopping.” There’s nothing more offensive to secular media liberals than faith. Hard to tell if it terrifies them more in the here-and-now or if they are looking toward the hereafter. That media pressure, and attacks by the “Late Show” host Stephen Colbert, Trevor Noah of “The Daily Show,” and CNN’s Chris Cillizza intimidated the Boy Scouts into distancing themselves from Trump. Based on the cheering Trump received, there was no such distance between the president and the Scouts who heard him speak. 3. Those Hateful Conservatives, Oops!: We’ve watched six months of demented hate from the lefty media against White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer. He’s gone, so now we’ll get demented hate from the media against new White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Ira Madison III, who writes about culture for The Daily Beast and GQ, welcomed Sanders with a cruel critique of her looks. Madison tweeted: “Butch queen first time in drags at the ball,” next to a picture of Sanders. Conservatives were outraged but liberals barely noticed. The War on Women only applies to liberal women, after all. White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci called it “reprehensible” and asked for an apology. Madison gave a half-hearted one for his “ill-judged joke.” While working at MTV News earlier this year, Madison embarrassed himself by bashing then-Sen. Jeff Sessions. He accused Sessions of using an Asian-American girl as a “prop” during a hearing. “Sessions, sir, kindly return this Asian baby to the Toys 'R' Us you stole her from,” he wrote on Twitter. The girl was actually Sessions’ granddaughter. Madison deleted the comment. Never forget that the left believes in “NO H8TE.” Or, in the words of Madison’s bosses at The Daily Beast, they value “an inclusive culture, committed to the public good.” 4. The Media Climate Isn’t Changing: Liberals whine about global warming, but the media climate is just the same as it was 11 years ago when the film “An Inconvenient Truth” came out. Who cares if climate guru Al Gore warned then that Earth had only 10 years before Mother Earth turned crispier and reached a “point of no return?” That didn’t stop him from going Hollywood and producing a sequel. The news and entertainment media loved Gore then and love him now. His silly “Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power” hits national theaters Aug. 4. To ensure the propaganda (Oops, documentary) is successful, Viacom is deploying 10 of its TV outlets to push the film. Viacom, which has “approximately 700 million global subscribers,” is harassing viewers on  MTV, VH1, LOGO, Comedy Central, Spike, BET, CMT, TV Land, Nick@Nite and Teen Nick. MTV will actually air a town hall where, “Gore will be joined by rapper and Miami resident Fat Joe, as well as 17-year-old activist Delaney Reynolds; DJ and fellow Miami-born artist Steve Aoki will act as a correspondent.” Apparently, no sports mascots were also available.   Dan Gainor is the Media Research Center's Vice President for Business and Culture.

articles[35] = " \n                                     \n                                 The title of Hillary Clinton's memoir on her failed 2016 campaign for the White House has at long last finally been revealed, ending the suspense for left-wing policy wonks. Hillary has officially gone from \"What difference does it make\" to “What Happened.” “What Happened” will chronicle what Hillary was “thinking and feeling during one of the most controversial and unpredictable presidential elections in history,” according to the synopsis released by the publisher. The publisher goes on to breathlessly describe the tell-all: “Now free from running, Hillary takes you inside the intense personal experience of becoming the first woman nominated for president by a major party in an election marked by rage, sexism, exhilarating highs and infuriating lows, stranger-than-fiction twists, Russian interference and an opponent who broke all the rules.” That’s right. Hillary Clinton wants to convince you she believes in rules. Sources who claim to have spoken to her people about the book say it’s a “bombshell” and say she blames her historic election loss on former FBI Director James Comey and, of course, the Russians. Will Hillary tell us the Russians parked a supersonic stealth submarine in Lake Michigan and cloaked the entire state of Wisconsin for over 100 days, preventing her from visiting the state once? “What Happened” is Hillary’s hubris, accompanied by a bubbling distrust among the public over the enshrined Hollywood-media complex. She underestimated an opponent she herself wanted to face off against and was a terrible candidate. That cost her a place in history. Hillary definitely won’t tell you what really happened. Valid concerns were raised about her health after she collapsed at the 9/11 Memorial in New York City, an event that she at first attempted to shield from the media. It only became a full-blown scandal when a private citizen with a video camera caught the whole thing and broadcast it on Twitter. Hillary also won’t tell you that her campaign strategy was, in many ways, just plain dumb. And she won’t tell you that Donald Trump simply outworked her by campaigning at a ratio of almost 2 to 1 in battleground states, as reported by NBC News shortly after the election. “Over the final 100 days of the election, Trump made a total of 133 visits to Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Carolina, Michigan and Wisconsin,” NBC reported. “Over the same time period, Hillary Clinton visited the first five of those states a total of 87 times. She never traveled to Wisconsin during the 102 days between the convention and the election.” What Hillary Clinton also won’t tell you is that Donald Trump was carried to the White House by 218 counties across the Rust Belt of the United States that had previously voted for Barack Obama’s message of hope and change. After eight years, many Obama voters were left without hope. Nothing had changed for the better. Voters were now strapped with a financial catastrophe in ObamaCare and some fell victim to a ravaging epidemic of opioid addiction. Hillary Clinton was more interested in appearing with millionaire celebrities, while telling coal miners she was going to put them out of work.  Hillary may tell you that James Comey’s letter to Congress on Oct. 28,, which addressed the prior unknown existence of emails discovered on a laptop belonging to her aide Huma Abedin and Abedin’s then-husband Anthony Weiner (as part of an FBI investigation into Weiner’s underage sexting scandal), cost her the election. What Hillary won’t tell you is that just four days prior, news hit that ObamaCare premiums in 2017 would spike over 22 percent The Comey letter certainly had an impact on voters, but it was prompted by a self-inflicted wound to a badly managed campaign and an email scandal that could have been avoided. However, when news of ObamaCare premiums once again spiking hit, Hillary was left flat-footed and without an answer.  Hillary probably won’t tell you about her former position that the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal was the gold standard in such agreements, as she did in her previous memoir. That left her open to a policy attack from Trump’s sweet spot, which left her speechless on a debate stage, other than to say that Donald Trump called a beauty queen “fat” 20 years ago. Hillary’s support and then opposition to the TPP agreement was emblematic of her many flips and flops over the course of 25 years. These went from violent crime and bringing super predators to heel, to DOMA, DADT, RFRA and other acronyms that  her husband signed into law that she no longer claimed to support.  Hillary won’t tell you that she had the lowest approval ratings of any presidential candidate in the history of the United States not named Donald Trump, but still was defeated by Trump. “What Happened” is Hillary’s hubris, accompanied by a bubbling distrust among the public over the enshrined Hollywood-media complex. She underestimated an opponent she herself wanted to face off against and was a terrible candidate. That cost her a place in history. You’re not going to get the real story of ‘What Happened’ from Hillary Clinton, because Hillary Clinton is what happened. You’re going to hear “Russia, Russia, Russia.” You can save the $25 and hear the same thing every day on CNN for free.  Stephen L. Miller has written for Heat Street and National Review Online.

articles[36] = " \n                                     \n                                 If President Trump wants to fulfill his repeated promise to end ObamaCare, his best course of action is a radical change in tactics that would hit members of Congress where it hurts – in their wallets. The 55-45 vote Wednesday by the Senate rejecting a straight repeal of ObamaCare makes it clear that the president needs to try something new. With a mere stroke of his pen, President Trump could end the exemption that President Obama gave members of Congress and their staffs that makes them the only participants in the ObamaCare exchanges to receive generous subsidies from their employer (the American people) to pay for their health insurance. Nothing would better focus Congress’ attention on changing ObamaCare than being trapped in it just like other Americans. When Vice President Pence was asked about the special exemption for Congress by Fox News’ \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" on Wednesday, he lamented that it was “pretty typical” for there to be “one set of rules for the American people and another for the political class here in our nation’s capital.” But he wouldn’t be pinned down over whether the Trump administration would act: “It would be (President Trump’s) decision to rescind that special treatment for members of Congress and their staffs,” he told Carlson Well, it’s about time. Ending the special perk funded by taxpayers may represent the only leverage President Trump has to fulfill his promise to repeal ObamaCare.  Ending the special perk funded by taxpayers may represent the only leverage President Trump has to fulfill his promise to repeal ObamaCare. Back in 2009, when ObamaCare was being debated, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) was able to insert a provision requiring all members of Congress and their staffs to get insurance through the ObamaCare health exchanges. “The more that Congress experiences the laws it passes, the better,” said Grassley.  Although his amendment was watered down to exclude committee staff, it still applies to members of Congress and their personal staffs. Most employment lawyers interpreted that to mean that the taxpayer-funded federal health insurance subsidies dispensed to members of Congress and their personal staffs – which now range from $6,000 to $12,000 a year and cover about 70 percent of the cost of insurance premiums – would have to end. Democratic and Republican staffers alike were furious, and along with members of Congress applied behind-the-scenes pressure on the White House. During a congressional recess in August 2013, President Obama personally ordered the Office of Personnel Management, which supervises federal employment issues, to interpret the law so as to retain the generous congressional benefits. This overturned the intent of the provision Grassley added to the law. OPM had previously balked at issuing such a ruling. Even without OPM, Congress could have voted to restore the subsidies or ordered a pay raise to compensate for the loss of benefits, but that would have been a messy public process, which everyone wanted to avoid. Former Republican Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana says the OPM ruling removed “the sting of ObamaCare” from Congress. He led a fight until his retirement from the Senate this year to wipe out any special treatment for Congress.   The Congressional Leadership Empire decided to strike back at Vitter. Politico reported in 2013 that several Democratic senators asked staff to draft legislation that would deny federal health subsidies to anyone who voted for the Vitter bill, even if it didn’t become law. Naturally, the bill went nowhere. Vitter believed his approach would be the best way to get the attention of Congress. “Many Americans are seeing their health coverage dropped by employers, and they are then forced into the exchanges,” he told me in 2013. “If Congress is forced into them on the same terms, it will be more likely to fix ObamaCare’s problems for others.” Polls taken by Independent Women’s Voice, a free market group, find that 94 percent of voters think Congress shouldn’t be exempted from the insurance provisions of ObamaCare. Most voters blame both parties equally for the exemption, which means Republicans will also be hurt politically if it stands. “The president should announce that he is instructing OPM to end the exemption and subsidies for Congress,” IWV president Heather Higgins wrote in Monday’s Wall Street Journal.  ”If the president does this, he’d have huge negotiating leverage. He would align the interests of the ruling class with those of his voters, forcing Congress to act. He might even get some Democratic votes.”  John Fund is a columnist for National Review.

articles[37] = " \n                                     \n                                 Knowing they need a positive agenda, Democrats have spent months preparing to offer more than blind resistance to virtually everything President Trump does or says. After countless focus groups and consultations with all of the party’s ideological grouplets, party leaders unveiled a new slogan Monday they hoped would rival Trump’s famous “Make America Great Again.” The new Democratic slogan is significantly less great and more wordy: “A Better Deal: Better Jobs, Better Wages, Better Future.” And in a bit of terrible timing, top Democrats announced their new slogan just as cable news networks were giving live coverage to presidential son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, who spoke at the White House to deny improper actions involving Russia. Like a faulty rocket, the Democratic slogan never got very far and quickly fell to Earth. Vox congressional reporter Jeff Stein notes that a Democratic member of Congress told him the slogan was “the result of months of polling and internal deliberations among the House Democratic caucus.\" But if that’s true, you’d think they would have figured out the new slogan is strangely similar to the current pitch for Papa John’s Pizza: \"Better Ingredients. Better Pizza. Papa John's.\"  Democrats who are veterans of Barack Obama’s two successful presidential races were quick to heap scorn on what one called “the rhetorical equivalent of a soggy, tasteless slab or pizza dough.”   Then Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton held up a book entitled “Stronger Together”. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\n                        \n                     “If your slogan uses a colon or a comma, back to the drawing board,” tweeted Jon Favreau, the former head of speechwriting for President Obama. “Fire every consultant involved,” added Jon Levitt, another former Obama speechwriter. To make matters worse, within days of unveiling a preliminary version of the slogan, it was learned it had also been lifted in part from a May 24 USA Today op-ed by Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), who was Hillary Clinton’s running-mate last year and helped take the Democratic Party into an historic and unexpected defeat. Kaine summarized his message in his USA Today piece as: “Better Skills, Better Jobs, Better Wages,” and called this “a pro-growth economic message that is true to who Democrats are.” It’s certainly true that even with the stolen slogan, the new Democratic message is an improvement over Hillary Clinton’s vapid 2016 race (where her slogan, “Stronger Together,” was notably weak). The new slogan contains some valuable insights on how to make job training programs more relevant and encourage apprenticeships.  But too much of it is a series of warmed-over excuses for higher government spending on dubious programs and pump priming. The Democratic proposals will lead many independent and moderate voters to conclude the new slogan is trying to sell them on the policy equivalent of a mediocre slab of pizza slathered with 40-year-old ingredients and precious little meat. There’s just not that much of a market for a stale product like that.   Herbert Hoover was elected president in 1928 on a slogan of “A chicken for every pot.” Will the Democrats next try updating that to “A pizza for every plate”?     John Fund is a columnist for National Review.

It certainly does not constitute a crime. After the election and before President Trump took office, Kushner received over 50 contacts with people from more than 15 countries while he was acting on behalf of the president-elect. Previous entering presidents and their transition teams have engaged in similar contacts and conversations.  According to Kushner’s public statement, he met with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, to discuss improved relations and “to address U.S. policy in Syria.” Later, Kushner met with a Russian banker, Sergey Gorkov, “who could give insight into how President Putin was viewing the new administration and best ways to work together.” Exactly how are those meetings counterproductive, uncommon or illegal? They are not.         Sergey Kislyak in 2013.\n                        \n                             (AP Photo/Cliff Owen, File)\n                        \n                     I spoke with Professor W. David Clinton, Chairman of the Political Science Department at Baylor University, who co-authored the seminal book, \"Presidential Transitions and American Foreign Policy.\" Having read Kushner’s statement, the professor remarked that he found nothing wrong with these meetings. He pointed out that it is the very same practice employed by other presidential transitions: “It is common for representatives of other governments to get in touch with the incoming presidential administration to begin informal relationships and address relevant issues. It is not unusual. Transitions are fairly long. The incoming administration needs to inform itself of foreign policy. Getting to know people and foreign governments is widely done and beneficial to the U.S.” Accusations that Kushner violated the Logan Act are without merit. The act prohibits private citizens from interfering in diplomatic disputes with foreign governments. If Kushner’s statement is true, then he did nothing of the sort.  Having a discussion about improved diplomatic relations, or how to better handle the conflict and humanitarian crisis in Syria, does not violate the Logan Act. Passed in 1799, no one has ever been convicted under the Act – largely because it is regarded as an unconstitutional violation of the First Amendment. Jared Kushner on on Capitol Hill July 24.\n                        \n                             (REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein)\n                        \n                     Kushner was not acting as a private citizen, as the law defines it. He was acting in a wholly different capacity – as a government representative of a president about to assume office. Moreover, he was not interfering in a diplomatic dispute.  Just the opposite. He was preparing the incoming administration for the foreign policy challenges that lay ahead and establishing the kind of vital contact that assists a new president in formulating effective relationships and policies. In other words, Kushner was doing his job. He did it in the same manner that other transition officials have done in previous administrations.  By his statement, Kushner disabused the media report that he sought some “secret back channel” to the Russian government. Russian generals apparently wanted to “provide information” on Syria that might prove helpful. An attempt, perhaps, at cooperation and future coordination as the U.S. seeks to destroy ISIS in Syria.  The Russian ambassador asked if there was a secure line in the transition office to conduct such a conversation. There wasn’t. Kushner, interested in defusing the humanitarian crisis in Syria, asked if the existing communications at the embassy could be used. It could not. End of discussion. Secure lines are not an extraordinary means of communicating with foreign governments. Indeed, they are routine, especially when prospective military information is being shared. It is neither nefarious nor criminal. Donald Trump Jr. on June 5.\n                        \n                             (AP Photo/Kathy Willens, File)\n                        \n                     Why did Kushner not mention these meetings when he submitted his Security Clearance Form on January 18, 2017? As he explained, his assistant mistakenly sent what was only an uncompleted draft. It omitted all foreign contacts, not just the Russian meetings. The error was noticed immediately, the transition team notified that night, and the FBI informed the next day and given supplemental information that disclosed “numerous contacts with foreign officials.” A complete and accurate list was forthcoming which “later disclosed over one hundred contacts from more than twenty countries.” In fact, the Security Clearance form instructs that the document can be “updated and clarified” as part of the clearance process. There is no evidence Kushner tried to deliberately deceive the government.    Kushner admits he dropped in on the now-infamous meeting that Donald Trump Jr. held at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer and others during the campaign. He insists he arrived late, had no idea what the meeting was about, and left quickly when he realized the subject matter was all about the issue of the U.S. ban on Russian adoptions.  Though he heard no talk at the meeting of campaign activity, such a discussion would not have been prohibited under law, as explained in an earlier column.    Yet for months, Jared Kushner has been mugged by the media mob.

During an April 11, 2013, House Armed Services Committee hearing, Congressman Doug Lamborn, R-Colo., inadvertently revealed several unclassified sentences from a DIA report that said DIA had determined with “moderate confidence” that North Korea has the capability to make a nuclear weapon small enough to be launched with a ballistic missile. The Director of National Intelligence and Obama officials subsequently tried to dismiss Lamborn’s disclosure by claiming the DIA assessment was an outlier that did not reflect the views of the rest of the U.S. Intelligence Community.  Obama officials tried to downplay the DIA assessment to prevent it from being used to force the president to employ a more assertive North Korea policy.  It was clear what Obama officials were doing in 2013.  The DIA report represented inconvenient facts that threatened President Obama’s North Korea “strategic patience” policy -- a policy to do nothing about North Korea and kick this problem down the road to the next president.  Obama officials tried to downplay the DIA assessment to prevent it from being used to force the president to employ a more assertive North Korea policy.  It’s worth noting that the Trump White House has not condemned the Washington Post story as a leak.  That’s probably because it was an authorized disclosure of classified information to advance President Trump’s North Korea strategy.  That is, instead of concealing intelligence to avoid taking action against the tough North Korea problem like the Obama administration did, the Trump administration publicized this same intelligence to demonstrate the seriousness of this threat and why decisive action by the United States is required. I believe Trump officials timed the release of the North Korea missile warhead information to bolster their efforts to pressure China to abide by new sanctions imposed on North Korea last weekend by the UN Security Council.  If so, this is a good strategy to highlight to Beijing the urgency that it abide by these sanctions and also implement other kinds of diplomatic and economic pressure against North Korea that it has so far refused to employ.  As I wrote in an August 7 Fox News Opinion article, this may be China’s last chance to prevent a military conflict with North Korea. Americans need to recognize as they ponder the increasingly dangerous North Korea situation that the Obama administration not only refused to do anything about this crisis but tried to downplay and conceal intelligence from the American people and Congress on how serious it was.   Fred Fleitz is senior vice president for policy and programs with the Center for Security Policy, a national security think tank.

In a stirring victory for those who live in the national’s capital, a panel of the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals recently threw out a D.C. ordinance that denied concealed-carry permits to anyone who could not show a “special” need for self-defense, what is referred to as a “good reason” requirement.  The problem is that other courts of appeal have upheld such restrictive laws and the U.S. Supreme Court has turned down appeals of those decisions, refusing to take up the issue of the Second Amendment’s application to carrying a weapon outside of the home. This happened most recently at the very end of the Supreme Court’s 2017 term in June when it refused to take up Peruta v. California, an appeal of a decision of the Ninth Circuit upholding California’s good reason requirement.   In a scathing dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas (joined by Neil Gorsuch) castigated the other justices for treating the Second Amendment “as a disfavored right.”  He said it was long-past time for the Court to decide this issue and that he found it “extremely improbable that the Framers understood the Second Amendment to protect little more than carrying a gun from the bedroom to the kitchen.” In the opinion over the District of Columbia’s concealed carry law written by Judge Thomas Griffith of the D.C. Circuit, Griffith pointed out that the U.S. Supreme Court’s first “in-depth examination of the Second Amendment” occurred in 2008 in District of Columbia v. Heller, where the Court threw out D.C.’s complete ban on handguns as unconstitutional.  That decision is “younger than the first iPhone.” The Supreme Court did not outline how the Second Amendment applies to the carrying of a weapon in public, but as Griffith says, Heller reveals “the Second Amendment erects some absolute barriers than no gun law may breach.” After Heller, D.C. implemented a complete ban on concealed carry. That was struck down in 2014 in Palmer v. District of Columbia. D.C. responded by restricting concealed-carry permits only to those who could show a “good reason to fear injury.” That required showing a “special need for self-protection distinguishable from the general community as supported by evidence of specific threats or previous attacks.” Living in a high-crime neighborhood wasn’t a good enough reason for a concealed-carry permit under D.C.’s regulation. In essence, you had to prove you had a good reason to exercise your constitutional right, a bizarre situation unique in American constitutional jurisprudence. D.C. argued, absurdly enough, that its ordinance did not violate any constitutional right because the Second Amendment doesn’t apply outside of the home.  Judge Griffith dismissed this claim, saying that the “fact that the need for self-defense is most pressing in the home doesn’t mean that self-defense at home is the only right at the [Second] Amendment’s core.”  Obviously, the need for self-defense “might arise beyond as well as within the home.” Further, the Second Amendment’s “text protects the right to ‘bear’ as well as ‘keep’ arms.” Thus, it is natural that the core of the Second Amendment includes “a law-abiding citizen’s right to carry common firearms for self-defense beyond the home.” Even under Heller, governments can apply regulations on the possession and carrying of firearms that are “longstanding,” such as bans on possession by felons “or bans on carrying near sensitive sites” such as government buildings. But preventing carrying in public is not a “longstanding” tradition or rule. This opinion goes into detail discussing the long American and English history applicable to weapons and self-defense, going back as far as the Statute of Northampton of 1328 -- whose text, as the court says, will “remind Anglophiles of studying Canterbury Tales – in the original.” But the state of the law “in Chaucer’s England – or for that matter Shakespeare’s or Cromwell’s – is not decisive here.” What is decisive is that the Supreme Court established in Heller that “by the time of the Founding, the ‘preexisting right’ enshrined by the Amendment had ripened to include carrying more broadly than the District contends based on its reading of the 14th-century statute.” According to Griffith, “the individual right to carry common firearms beyond the home for self-defense – even in densely populated areas, even for those lacking special self-defense needs – falls within the core of the Second Amendment’s protections.” Unfortunately, other federal courts of appeals have upheld similar “good reason” laws for concealed carry permits. But as Judge Griffith points out, those courts “dispensed with the historic digging that would have exposed” that their toleration of regulations restricting the carrying of a weapon is “faulty.” The constitutional analysis that should be applied to all government gun regulations is that they must allow “gun access at least for each typical member” of the American public. Because D.C.’s restrictive “good reason” concealed-carry law “bars most people from exercising” their Second Amendment right “at all,” it is unconstitutional. At a minimum, the Second Amendment “must protect carrying given the risks and needs typical of law-abiding citizens.” The court drew together “all the pieces” of its analysis in this way: At the Second Amendment’s core lies the right of responsible citizens to carry firearms for personal self-defense beyond the home, subject to longstanding restrictions. These traditional limits include, for instance, licensing requirements, but not bans on carrying in urban areas like D.C. or bans on carrying absent a special need for self-defense. In fact, the Amendment’s core at a minimum shields the typically situated citizen’s ability to carry common arms generally. The District’s good-reason law is necessarily a total ban on exercises of that constitutional right for most D.C. residents. That’s enough to sink this law under Heller I. One of the judges on the D.C. panel, Karen LeCraft Henderson, dissented, arguing that the “core” right in the Second Amendment is only to possess a firearm in one’s home and she saw no problem with D.C.’s good-reason requirement. That dissent, along with the contrary decisions of other appeals courts, shows why the Supreme Court needs to follow Justice Thomas’s admonition and finally settle this issue.  As Thomas scolds in his dissent in Peruta: For those of us who work in marble halls, guarded constantly by a vigilant and dedicated police force, the guarantees of the Second Amendment might seem antiquated and superfluous.  But the Framers made a clear choice: They reserved to all Americans the right to bear arms for self-defense.  I do not think we should stand by idly while a State denies its citizens that right, particularly when their very lives may depend on it.

Just moments after President Trump promoted Sarah Huckabee Sanders to the role of White House press secretary, she was attacked by a swarm of woman-hating liberals. Click here for a free subscription to Todd’s newsletter: a must-read for Conservatives! First, the propagandists at The New York Times and MSNBC questioned Sanders’ character and called her a liar, but now journalists are attacking her physical appearance. July 18, 2017: July 18, 2017: Deputy White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders smiles as she speaks during an off-camera press briefing at the White House in Washington.\n                        \n                             (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n                        \n                     Ira Madison, III, of The Daily Beast, likened Sanders to a drag queen in a hateful posting on Twitter. “Butch queen first time in drags at ball,” he tweeted to his followers – along with a photograph of the press secretary. Madison is the same “journalist” who cracked a racially-charged “joke” about Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ Asian-American granddaughter during his confirmation hearings. His tweet implied Sessions had borrowed her from a Toys-R-Us store so that he could use her as a political prop. Madison later apologized and deleted the tweet. And he also penned a disgusting attack on Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson – wondering if his rule in the Trump White House was going to be “house or field.” Hollywood was especially unkind to Sanders. “I fetl like Sarah Huckabee Sanders left and right eye switched places or something,” comedian Akliah Hughes wrote on Twitter. “Sarah Huckabee Sanders looks like every woman eating lobster on a cruise ship,” “Family Guy” writer Damien Fahey tweeted. Sarah Huckabee Sanders looks like every woman eating lobster on a cruise ship. Could you imagine the hellfire and brimstone that would’ve rained down had a journalist or comedian made similar remarks about former first lady Michelle Obama? The outrage over the attacks on Sanders has been limited to a few conservative publications and this column. There has been no outcry from the feminist movement or female news commentators or enlightened liberals. It’s as if the “Nasty Woman” crowd pulled their “p---y” hats over their eyes and ears – hoping to tune out the anti-woman hate spewing from the left. The same thing happened when “Saturday Night Live” skewered her in a deplorable body-shaming sketch. Meanwhile, the mainstream media spent the weekend attacking the newly-appointed White House communications director for what they perceived to be sexist comments directed at Sanders. Anthony Scaramucci told CNN’s Jake Tapper that he’s only asked one thing of Sanders. “Sarah, if you’re watching,” he said, “I love the hair and makeup person that we had on Friday, so I’d like to continue to use the hair and makeup person.” Critics pounced and accused Scaramucci of making comments regarding Sanders’ personal appearance. That was clearly not the case – but it did not seem to matter to the mainstream media. His comment generated headlines in the Washington Post, The Hill, Newsweek and the list goes on and on and on. And yet those same news outlets ignored The Daily Beast smear. It’s the kind of double standard conservative women have come to expect from the mainstream media. Kellyanne Conway offered some sound advice to Sanders on Sunday – suggesting she ignore the “jackals and hyenas” attacking her. Anthony Scaramucci, incoming White House communications director, shakes hands with the White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders as he takes the podium at the daily press briefing at the White House in Washington.\n                        \n                             (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\n                        \n                     “[The] irony of modern feminism is that they look right past sexist comments said about conservative women, definitely pro-life women like Sarah and me,” she told “Fox & Friends.” Some might call Madison a thug or a bully or a small-handed guttersnipe who gets his jollies by smacking around women with cheap, misogynistic words. And they would not be incorrect. But if it’s all the same – I’ll just call him a sexist pig.  Todd Starnes is host of Fox News & Commentary.

At a historic pace, this president has taken bold action to restore prosperity, keep Americans safe and secure, and hold government accountable. President Trump has signed more than 40 bills and nearly 40 executive orders on everything from health care to energy, infrastructure and more. While the previous administration turned to federal agencies to enact its agenda, President Trump has signed more laws to slash through federal red tape than any president in American history and has saved businesses up to $18 billion a year in costs. And whereas the last administration stifled the use of America’s vast energy resources, President Trump has put a renewed emphasis on American energy – approving the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, rolling back the Clean Power Plan, and putting America First by withdrawing from the Paris climate accord. President Trump inherited an economy that would barely budge – but under his watch, American businesses small and large have already created more than 800,000 new jobs since January. Company after company is responding to the president’s agenda with optimism – investing billions of dollars in American jobs, American workers and America’s future. As the father of a United States Marine, I couldn’t be more proud to serve alongside a president who cares so deeply about the men and women of the armed forces of the United States of America.  After years of so-called “sequestration” and budget cuts to our armed forces, President Trump has already signed the largest increase in defense spending in nearly 10 years and called for the greatest investment in military readiness since the days of President Ronald Reagan. It is the greatest privilege of my life to serve as vice president to a president who is fighting every single day to restore an America of freedom, prosperity and opportunity for all. And this president calls our enemy by its name – radical Islamic terrorism – and with the leadership of this commander-in-chief our armed forces are taking the fight to ISIS on our terms on their soil.  When it comes to security here in the homeland, President Trump has taken decisive steps to secure our borders and enforce our laws – a direct contrast with the previous administration. And while illegal immigration was rampant in recent years, our administration has been working with local law enforcement to take drug dealers, members of gangs like MS-13, and other violent criminals off our streets. Illegal crossings at our southern border are down by more than 60 percent since the start of this year.  After the previous president tried to stack the courts with liberal jurists, our president made a commitment to appoint federal judges who will uphold the Constitution and the God-given liberties enshrined there. Look no further than the newest Supreme Court Justice, Neil Gorsuch. Judge Neil Gorsuch shakes hands with Supreme Court Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy after being sworn in as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, accompanied by Louise Gorsuch (C) and U.S. President Donald J. Trump in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, U.S., April 10, 2017. REUTERS/Carlos Barria - RTX34YQB\n                        \n                     President Trump’s accomplishments are nothing short of historic. But as the president likes to say, at this White House that's just what we call a good start. President Trump will not rest and he will not relent until we keep our promise to the American people and repeal and replace ObamaCare. President Trump has called on the Congress to do its job, and we will continue to work with both the House and Senate to give the American people health care reform built on the principles of personal responsibility, free-market competition and state-based reforms. President Trump is firmly committed to passing the largest tax cut since the days of President Reagan. We’re going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms. We’ll simplify the tax code. We’ll eliminate the alternative minimum tax. We’ll make the code flatter and fairer for everyone. And under President Trump, we will repeal death taxes once and for all.  And to get this economy moving again, we’re going to cut business taxes in America so that companies in this country can compete with companies around the world and create good jobs right here in America.  We’ll end the broken system that penalizes companies for calling America home. And we’ll cut taxes on trillions of dollars that are locked away overseas so that American businesses can invest in America’s future. It is the greatest privilege of my life to serve as vice president to a president who is fighting every single day to restore an America of freedom, prosperity and opportunity for all. So with boundless faith in the American people, with faith in President Trump’s vision and determination, and with faith in God who has ever watched over this Land of the Free and Home of the Brave, I say with confidence: We will make America safe again. We will make America prosperous again. And to borrow a phrase, we will Make America Great Again.  Mike Pence is vice president of the United States."
articles[44] = " \n                                     \n                                 The law is common sense. Yet, it is created by lawmakers who seem to be lacking any sense at all.  Many of them do not understand their own laws.     Nancy Pelosi recently proved this point. The House Minority Leader held a news conference, surrounded by like-minded Democrats, during which she declared that Donald Trump Jr. had broken campaign laws when he met with a Russian lawyer during last year’s presidential campaign to obtain negative information on the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.  Here is what Pelosi said: “This is a campaign violation: soliciting, coordinating, or accepting something of value --opposition research, documents, and information—from a foreign national. Plain and simple.”        In truth, it is plain and simple that Pelosi is wrong. And so are many others who have joined the chorus of condemnation based on laws they have surely never read. Allow me to help them out.    The Federal Election Commission is the independent regulatory agency which enforces campaign laws enacted by Congress.  On its government website, the FEC makes it clear that it is perfectly lawful for foreign nationals to be involved in American political campaigns:     “Even though a foreign national cannot make campaign contributions, he or she can serve as an uncompensated volunteer for a campaign or political party”. The Commission goes on to explain that foreigners are “allowed to attend campaign strategy meetings and events”. They are allowed to contribute ideas, information, and even advice. They are allowed to open their mouths and speak. None of this is considered to be a donation or “anything of value” under the campaign statutes, as some Democrats and many in the media allege.  To the contrary, the Commission specifically states, “an individual may volunteer his or her personal services to a campaign without making a campaign contribution”.  The same language is found in both the Federal Election Campaign Act (52 USC 30101 8-B) and the Code of Federal Regulations (100.74): “The value of services provided by any individual who volunteers on behalf of a candidate or political committee is not a contribution.” Why are foreigners on American soil allowed to volunteer their services and provide information to political campaigns in U.S. elections? The reason should be obvious –the Constitution.       The First Amendment gives Americans the freedom to associate with whomever they want, including Russians. It gives people the freedom to exchange ideas and information , even with Russians. As long as the information is neither stolen nor classified, there is no crime. There is no civil wrong.    We do not criminalize free speech and free association in America.  Yet, there is this false mentality that all Russians are boogeymen.  And talking to them is somehow a crime.  It is not.  The founders of our Constitution would be mortified at that notion.  One commentator recently said, “Donald Trump Jr. had an absolute duty to notify the FBI”. Why? Where is that law or duty written?  If it is not a crime to exchange information with a Russian, why should the FBI be notified? Why would FBI agents be interested in legal activity? Trust me, they are not. Even if a citizen learns of a crime, there is no affirmative duty imposed by law to report it to law enforcement.  Talking with a Russian and gathering information is not a crime.  Yet Pelosi and others allege that the president’s son may also be guilty of conspiracies to commit espionage and defraud the government.  As explained in an earlier column, the Trump Jr. meeting is not treason because we are not at war with Russia. It is not collusion in any criminal sense, because that only applies to anti-trust cases.  It is not conspiracy to defraud the government, because the statute requires deceit and dishonesty. And it is not a violation of election laws, because foreign nationals are specifically permitted to volunteer personal services and information to political campaigns.  As for espionage…seriously? What U.S. secrets or classified information is Pelosi talking about?    Democrats and even some Republicans, like Gov. Chris Christie, are perpetuating the myth that laws must have been broken without ever knowing or studying the law. And many in the media are so ignorant of basic laws and oblivious to the Constitution, they are complicit in misinforming the public.   Rarely do we see a reporter or anchor ask a lawmaker the tough, challenging question, “What laws, specifically, have been broken? Can you identify a precise statute?” The answer would be a deafening silence.  Our Constitution was never intended to embody a political point of view. It was made for people of fundamentally differing views. Unfortunately, those in Washington who should know that… do not.     And the media, which owes its existence to that esteemed document, seem to have forgotten its precious guarantees of freedom.   Gregg Jarrett is a Fox News Anchor and former defense attorney."
articles[45] =  "But instead of planning to pass any long-term funding, the president appeared willing to punt his big agenda items to December and focus on passing Hurricane relief funding. Trump met with House Speaker Paul Ryan, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. In a joint statement after the meeting, Pelosi and Schumer signaled that Trump had made a deal. “In the meeting, the President and Congressional leadership agreed to pass aid for Harvey, an extension of the debt limit, and a continuing resolution both to December 15, all together,” Schumer and Pelosi said in a statement after the meeting. “Both sides have every intention of avoiding default in December and look forward to working together on the many issues before us.” Trump signaled after the meeting that he was willing to move quickly to raise the debt ceiling for a three-month extension. “We had a very good meeting with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One. “We agreed to a three-month extension on debt ceiling, which they consider to be sacred — very important.” The president is currently traveling to North Dakota for a speech on tax reform. “We had a very good meeting. We essentially came to a deal, and I think the deal will be very good,” Trump said.  Republican leaders, however, had expressed before the meeting that they wanted a more substantial debt ceiling deal or some long term legislation.  Trump indicated that he had no problem raising the debt ceiling.  “Always we’ll agree on debt ceiling automatically because of the importance of it,” he said.  The White House requested $7.85 billion for emergency Harvey aid and called for Congress to raise the debt ceiling immediately. Congress has to pass an emergency funding bill for the victims of Hurricane Harvey in Louisiana and Texas and raise the debt ceiling. They also need to pass a budget or a continuing resolution to prevent a government shutdown. The group also discussed the future of DACA recipients and Trump’s six-month window allowing Congress to come up with a solution before the program ends.     Big Government, Chuck Schumer, Congress, Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell, Nancy Pelosi, Paul Ryan, White House"
articles[46] = "“Congress, I really believe, wants to take care of this situation,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One. “I really believe it — even very conservative members of Congress.” He appeared willing to negotiate with Republicans and Democrats on a DACA solution — even willing to add border security funding to help sell the measure to offer amnesty to DACA recipients. “I’d like to see something where we have good border security, and we have a great DACA transaction where everybody is happy and now they don’t have to worry about it anymore,” he said. Trump made his comments to reporters on Air Force One after meeting with House Speaker Paul Ryan, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer at the White House. He said his administration ended DACA because it wasn’t legal and would have failed to sustain a court challenge. “I’d like to see a permanent deal, and I think it’s going to happen,” he said, pointing to momentum on the issue from both Republicans and Democrats. “I really believe that Congress is going to work very hard on the DACA agreement and come up with something.” The president remained vague on what he would do if Congress did not send him legislation to legalize DACA recipients, signaling on Twitter on Tuesday night that he would “revisit the issue” if they failed. “I have a feeling that’s not going to be necessary,” he said on Wednesday.

articles[47] = "The deal is a warning to Republicans — primarily to the party establishment, which has fought Trump at every turn, but also to conservative Republicans, who have long worried about Trump shifting leftwards. It is no secret that Trump is frustrated with the party establishment, and particularly with congressional leaders, notably Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who failed to whip his caucus into delivering the votes to repeal and replace Obamacare. Conservatives were blamed for stalling the American Health Care Act in the House. But it was the moderates who tanked the Better Care Reconciliation Act in the Senate, and the last-ditch “skinny repeal.” Trump has long warned that he would work with Democrats, if necessary, to fulfill his campaign promises. And Wednesday’s deal is a sign that he intends to follow through on that threat. (He clearly intended it as such: though Republican leaders also signed off on the deal, Trump specifically name-checked the Democrats in his speech in North Dakota a few hours later, pointing to the agreement as a sign that Washington was starting to work again.) By working with Democrats, Trump can bypass the Republican leadership, GOP moderates, and personal foes like Sen. John McCain (R-AZ). However, it also means that he can cobble deals together between liberal Republicans and the Democrat minority, leaving conservatives out in the cold. The only way to stop him is for Republicans to unite. By showing he can deal with Pelosi and Schumer, Trump may have found the one way of making them do so. Joel B.

articles[48] = "Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the repeal of the Obama era executive order — known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program — both on constitutional grounds and also on principle. “The effect of this unilateral executive amnesty, among other things, contributed to a surge of unaccompanied minors on the southern border that yielded terrible humanitarian consequences,” Sessions said. “It also denied jobs to hundreds of thousands of Americans by allowing those same jobs to go to illegal aliens.” The move saw significant opposition from Democrats and voices in the media, while even some Republicans who formerly opposed DACA called for Congress to act to resolve the issue with legislation.  The rollback includes a six-month delay so as to allow Congress to act if it so chose. The White House had expressed hope that the issue could be included as part of a broader immigration legislation package, with Trump tweeting that he hoped to work with Democrats and Republicans for a reform “that puts hardworking citizens of our country 1st.” But by late Tuesday, Trump appeared to have turned into a paper tiger on the key campaign promise to get rid of DACA, saying he would “revisit this issue” if Congress did not “legalize DACA.” Congress now has 6 months to legalize DACA (something the Obama Administration was unable to do). If they can't, I will revisit this issue! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 6, 2017 The tweet appears to be adopting an argument used by many establishment Republicans that posits the problem with DACA was not its substance, but primarily that it was done unilaterally by President Obama, not through Congress. It is unlikely that Trump’s “America First” base, which supported Trump in part because of his focus on illegal immigration, will be satisfied with anything approaching a repeat of DACA — either by Congress or presidential pen. Perhaps sensing a possible cave, conservative commentator Ann Coulter tweeted before the announcement that millions of voters “not only won’t vote for [Trump] again, but will never vote Republican again if they pass this DACA amnesty.

articles[49] = "“I’ll tell you what, we walked out of there, Mitch and Paul and everybody, Kevin, and we walked out and everybody was happy,” Trump said after the meeting. “Not too happy — you can never be too happy, but they were happy enough.” The deal fit neatly with what House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wanted, but not what Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell or House Speaker Paul Ryan were looking for. Republicans wanted a longer, 18-month raise of the debt ceiling and government funding, while Democrats see the possibility of a government shutdown in December as a political opportunity. The measure will likely be attached to spending for Hurricane Harvey relief in Texas and Louisiana. But the White House argued that it was important to make a deal to ensure tax reform could happen. “We believe that helping to clear the decks in September enables us to focus on tax reform for the American people,” White House Director of Legislative Affairs Marc Short told reporters on Air Force One. “We need to get the economy growing again and that’s what we need to focus on.” Short said he planned to meet with Congressional members of the Freedom Caucus to discuss the deal, which he argued only extended the debt ceiling for a short time. Trump appeared delighted to find an easy solution to the process, which many in Washington thought would be bloody. “It was nice to see that happen for a change,” Trump said, during a tax reform speech in North Dakota. “That hasn’t happened for a long time in this country, for a very long time.” Big Government, aid, Air Force One, Chuck Schumer, Congress, debt, democrats, Donald Trump, Harvey, marc short, Nancy Pelosi"

And isn’t it ironic that we have all of these elected officials in Washington fighting for illegal aliens in our country?” She questioned how things got to the place where illegal aliens are seemingly more important than American citizens.

articles[53] =  "For all the pejorative “populist” talk about President Trump, his predecessor could not countenance something he regarded as unpopular, especially to his base, and a potential future base of the Democrat Party. The Obama doctrine across many aspects of his presidency was simply to kick the can down the road. That’s why within months we have heard of Trumpism, even Bannonism, but rarely did the world ever contemplate what ‘Obamaism’ was. The man was just another in a long line of tepid presidents since Ronald Reagan. But kicking the can down the road on DACA was in the policy’s very name. Deferred. Not cancelled. Postponed. Not abolished. Even so, the conditions under which DACA beneficiaries were allowed to remain the country were scarcely heinous on either side, if you set aside the rule of law, forget that these sorts of policies impact different states differently, and of course want to persuade the world that your legal immigration system is obviously the worst route through which to pursue U.S. residency. Besides all that, the policy is perfectly reasonable. If you didn’t sense the sarcasm there, you’re probably a liberal. The former president and his advisors clearly also saw no problems with any of this. Most importantly however, now, for the left, is its own cognitive dissonance on the matter of heritage, history, and accountability. Over the past few months we have had it battered into our heads — in some cases quite literally — that the beneficiaries of acts of immorality, illegality, or even just contextualised normality should be punished for the actions of their forebears. The white man especially, we are told, should bear responsibility for the actions of his great grandparents. Even when the actions were nothing but remaining silent in the face of what only now seems to us to be such obviously craven and deplorable behaviour. I am of course talking about slavery, and the demands the United States faces from the left and the minorities they have co-opted for their Marxist cause. Tear down statues. Rewrite history. Destroy whitey. Well, they’re at least thinking that last one. For you, reading this, are probably the benefactor of centuries of iniquity and you must be punished. Your ancestors didn’t break the law as it was at the time. But they broke the law as it is now. So you are culpable. What’s the use in imprisoning a corpse? Let’s flog America instead. And while the moral concerns regarding slavery versus the illegal crossing of a border are scarcely comparable — the notion of collective and/or hereditary punishment surely should give us pause. If the argument goes that “Dreamers” should not be punished for the actions of their parents, then why should modern Americans be punished for the actions of their grandparents, or even their European ancestors? Is it the scale of the crime committed? If so, which crime was committed at the time slavery was legal? None. Sure, we all think of it as repugnant now. But how could one seek to pass punitive measures on a few generations, if one is comfortable dismissing actual crimes committed by parents just a few decades on? It is this conundrum, this duplicity, and this anti-intellectualism that sets real America so drastically apart from the liberal left. While New York’s “elite” would have you believe it they are smarter than the average American, it is the latter that instinctively understand “fairness” as a concept, and are able to strike the balance between morality, constitutionality, and common sense. For Obama and his army of shrieking bleeding hearts — including many Republican legislators — the first of these notions is misplaced, and the last two are seemingly non-existent. Not only should DACA be rescinded, it should become a test case for the facts that firstly: you may not seek to penalize descendants for non-crimes; secondly, you may not directly benefit from criminal acts (as Dreamers do) and expect special treatment. At this point, I think DACA beneficiaries are lucky that the right is not floating the idea of retroactive prosecutions for breaking U.S. law. But then again, America is instinctively fair, and the right rarely ever goes for low blows — which that would inherently be — like the left.

articles[54] =  "Having spent 6 weeks (during 3 separate trips) on the road this summer, having spent time in about 10 different states, my own experience outside the media-fabricated bubble was an eye opener. Then the terrible devastation of Harvey came along and, I hope, broke the media’s wicked spell across the fruited plain. You need not live in Manhattan or DC to bubble yourself, and by extension, be hoodwinked by a media and Left desperate to crack our union in two. The only requirement is a news addiction fed by the establishment media. If that toxin is your primary portal to the outside world, you are being misled. And I say this not from On High, but from experience. Through this media portal, we are always portrayed as being at each other’s throats. And not just along political lines, which is not a terrible thing if you believe debate is good for democracy, but along toxified racial, gender, age, region, and lifestyle lines. Basically, the media fabricates the following: that old white men (i.e. Trump supporters) are desperate to hold on to their privilege at the expense brown, black, gay, female, and young Americans. And for this reason, every brown, black, gay, female, and young American must vote Democrat. Let’s begin with the fact that nearly half of those, 48%!,  who voted for Trump are NOT men. Let’s end with the fact that 43% of those who voted for Trump are NOT white. This means that there are, literally, tens of millions of non-whites and women who support this president. If you look at the establishment media, though, this inconvenient fact is intentionally memory-holed, all in service to a propaganda campaign meant to hustle Americans into believing we hate one another. The obvious goal is to turn propaganda into reality by fooling us into believing we must join a tribe, a tribe as defined by the media, a tribe that comports perfectly with the evil of identity politics, which can only result in putting elites and their centralized government back in power. The primary weapons in this propaganda war are extremist groups the media dishonestly uses as avatars for all of us. Therefore, it is no accident that every single one of these groups, starting with the KKK  and white supremacists, and ending with AntiFa and Black Lives Matter, are leftwing hate groups — groups conceived, birthed and raised by a Democrat Party desperate to cover up its failed ideas with grievance coalitions too shallow to see past their own precious identities. These hate groups also give the media its desired chaos narrative, the emotional blackmail that demands we take a side, which is, at its essence, a ransom note that reads: DEAR AMERICA: ALL THIS UGLINESS AND DIVISION WILL GO AWAY IF YOU VOTE THE WAY WE TELL YOU TO. By over-blowing and inundating us with 24/7 with strife and violence, by stressing us out, this is the media holding civility and the social compact hostage; demanding we pay a ransom that surrenders merit to identity and individual freedom to government. In other words, what you see 24/7 on CNN is not America. What you see on CNN, rather, is the America CNN wants to create through lies. The truth is this: even on a Big News night, no more than about 7 million tune into ALL of cable news, and any amount of time spent in the Real World is a revelation of just how little impact and influence the establishment media is having on our country. After six weeks on the road, after dozens of people in states as politically diverse as Illinois and South Carolina, Maryland and West Virginia, I am heartened to report that the people in this country get along, live and work together, just fine. Out in the Real World, no one’s taking it to the streets, obsessed with identity, or at each other’s throats. Politics almost never came up, and the few times it did ended with a handshake or hug. In fact, Americans of all stripes are busy living their lives, raising their kids, embracing summer. The only noticeable effect DC is having on Real America is an increased optimism about the economy. The very day that two leftwing groups — white supremacists and AntiFa — went after each other in Charlottesville, you want to know where I was? At a wedding in Chicago, in a building hosting five receptions simultaneously, in a place packed with hundreds of people of every conceivable racial background enjoying each other’s company. It was e pluribus unum on steroids. There was no tension, no awkwardness, no nothing other than Americans — AMERICANS — enjoying the fruits of hard work, family, friendship and community. And then Houston happened; good heavens, what a great country we are, what a great people we are. The very people who are ordered by the media to hate one another — blacks, Hispanics, whites, southerners, — instead helped, rescued, saved, consoled and soothed one another. From out of state, the Deplorables came, flying the flag of the Cajun Army, volunteering to risk their own lives to save a city that is much more black and Hispanic than not. What we are seeing in Houston is not the exception, is not the outlier. What we are seeing in Houston is who we are, is America.

articles[55] =   "What’s not to like about about Trump’s nomination of Rep. Jim Bridenstine (R-Oklahoma) for the job of NASA’s administrator? Everything, if you’re a liberal. According to New York Daily News columnist Linda Stasi, Trump just blew the perfect chance to change his “presidency from the chaotic mess of threats, bitterness and bilious paranoia to one of rationality and reasonableness.” Apparently, the job should have gone to a fully-fledged climate alarmist. There is no denying that our weather is getting more severe, that the oceans are rising, the Arctic ice is melting and hurricanes are wreaking ever-more havoc each time one pummels another part of the country. Harvey has officially brought the most destructive rainfall in our nation’s history — more than 51 inches in some areas of Houston. As many as 42,399 humans are in shelters. Yet in the face of all this, you, Mr. President, have chosen to nominate a climate change-denying partisan politician, Republican Rep. Jim Bridenstine, to head NASA. How can you even think of such a man. As this planet heats up, we have to look to space. That won’t be done if the man heading NASA denies the science and looks down on the truth of what’s happening in our atmosphere. It would be nice to dismiss this as merely the deranged frothings of a rent-an-opinion, left-wing columnist who has bizarrely chosen to borrow her surname from that of the secret police in former Communist East Germany. Unfortunately, she’s by no means the exception. Most liberals think as she does. Indeed, so do quite a few establishment conservatives. According to Florida Senator Marco Rubio – who insists that his criticisms have nothing to do with the fact that Bridenstine trashed him as being soft on terrorism during the presidential primaries – Bridenstine is too partisan a figure for the job. Rubio told Politico: “It’s the one federal mission which has largely been free of politics and it’s at a critical juncture in its history,” Rubio said. “I would hate to see an administrator held up — on [grounds of] partisanship, political arguments, past votes, or statements made in the past — because the agency can’t afford it and it can’t afford the controversy.” Wait just a second. NASA “a federal mission which has largely been free of politics”? What planet is Rubio living on?? NASA became SO politicized under the Obama administration it might as well have been renamed Greenpeace. In 2010, NASA’s then administrator Charles Bolden claimed in an interview with Al-Jazeera that President Obama now considered one of the organization’s primary missions to be Muslim outreach: Bolden said in the interview that Obama told him before he took the job that he wanted him to do three things: inspire children to learn math and science, expand international relationships and “perhaps foremost, he wanted me to find a way to reach out to the Muslim world and engage much more with dominantly Muslim nations to help them feel good about their historic contribution to science … and math and engineering.” Political enough for you, Senator Rubio? Then, of course, there’s the hijacking of NASA’s Goddard Institute of Space Studies by a bunch of climate alarmists, formerly led by James “Death Trains” Hansen, now led by the equally parti-pris Gavin “Toast” Schmidt. For years, NASA has been fraudulently tampering with the temperature data “on an unbelievable scale”. The sooner it gets back to its day job – clue: National Aeronautics And Space Administration – the better for the U.S. taxpayer, the better for space exploration, the better for science. Bridenstine sounds just the man for the job: Bridenstine is a proponent of the commercial space industry, introducing the Space Renaissance Act earlier this year. He’s also been a vocal advocate for opening up the Moon for commercial activity and establishing a permanent settlement on its surface. Bridenstine represents Oklahoma’s First Congressional District, where he was first elected in 2012. He currently serves on the House Armed Services and Science, Space, and Technology Committees. He served in the US Navy flying E-2C Hawkeyes and F-18 Hornets. After leaving active duty, he became the Executive Director of the Tulsa Air and Space Museum & Planetarium.   Big Government, Big Journalism, Climate Change, Goddard Institute of Space Studies, Jim Bridenstine, Marco Rubio, Muslim outreach, NASA, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Obama, Trump, U.S. taxpayer"

And I just didn't want anybody to die,\" @reveal host  @Al_Letson says https://t.co/69bNNhxQwC — NPR (@NPR) August 29, 2017 NPR, which describes Antifa in its reporting as people driven by a desire for equality and justice, actually led its story on the attack this way: “On Sunday a planned rally of right-wing activists in Berkeley, Calif., mostly fizzled out, but thousands of peaceful left-wing protesters turned out, singing songs and chanting,” NPR reported. “About 150 members of anti-facist groups — also known as antifa or black bloc protesters — also were there, marching in formation with covered faces,” NPR reported. “Then a couple of people from the right-wing did show up.” Letson then witnessed “one right-wing man fall to the ground, and some left-wing Antifia protesters beating him,” according to NPR. NPR questioned Letson about his motive for protecting the man, who is not only right-wing but white and Letson is black, NPR noted. “What came to me was that he was a human being, and I didn’t want to see anybody die,” Letson said. “And, you know, I’ve been thinking a lot about the events in Charlottesville, and I remember seeing the pictures of a young man being brutally beaten by these guys with poles, and when I saw that I thought, ‘why didn’t anybody step in?’” But, ironically, Letson said both his observations in Charlottesville and his experience in Berkeley has not changed his opinion on Antifa but rather has caused him to ponder “nuance” when it comes to left-wing violence. “It hasn’t really changed the way I think about them at all,” Letson said. “I think that the problem that happens when we have the Antifa or people on the left engaging in violence is that it shifts the narrative.” “Suddenly, we are equating people that are fighting Nazis with Nazis — and the two things don’t equate, right?” Letson said, adding that Nazis are exactly what we know them to be. But, “It’s a false equivalency to say that the people fighting back against that are the exact same,” Lesson said. “But I also see how the violence that is coming from the Antifa movement can be spun to make it seem like the two are equivalent.” “So you know, we’re living in tricky times when there’s a lot of nuance that needs to be walked through — and America is not good at nuance,” Letson said. “So I think, for me, it didn’t change the way I thought about them, but it does mean as a reporter, as a producer, as a journalist, that I’m thinking even more about what that nuance means, and how to communicate it to the audience.” But Letson also gave an interview to Slate, in which he accused the beating victim and the man he assumed to be his friend — Patriot Prayer founder Joey Gibson — of provoking the Antifa protesters. Slate: So walk me through how you ended up protecting this guy. Who was he? Al Letson: No idea who he was. The longer story is that there was the rally—I think one thing that people should know is that it was mostly a peaceful rally. It wasn’t like anarchy and fighting and brawling everywhere. It was mostly a peaceful thing. Most of the protesters there were not what I would call antifa. They were a mixture of people. The antifa were definitely there, but I would say that they were maybe 20 percent of the crowd? But they were there, and they showed up in force. So [far-right activist] Joey Gibson was doing his ‘Patriot Prayer’ thing—he came through with like two other guys, and he was antagonizing the black bloc, and it really escalated. So they started chasing Joey and this guy. They ran across the street—I’m literally right next to Joey while all this is happening, so I know this to be true—they ran into the police, and the police kind of protected them. But this other guy—I’m not sure if he was with Joey. It looked like he was, but I’m not sure. He was running in kind of a different place, and he stumbled—or someone tripped him—and then four or five people surrounded him and began to kick and hit him with like a flagpole. And I was just filming it, but at some point I looked behind him and I saw a whole mass of people coming, and I just thought that they were going to kill him. And, you know, I didn’t want anybody to die. So I just dropped my stuff and dove in and got on top of him. Originally I wasn’t planning on getting on top of him; I just wanted to shield him. I wanted to break it up, but then I realized there were too many of them, and there was no way that was going to happen. NPR also questioned Letson about whether he was concerned about violating the journalistic taboo of becoming part of the story instead of just reporting the story. “I don’t want to be a part of the story, at all,” Letson said. “And I believe in all of those journalistic ethics and all of that — but I also think that, before that, I’m a human being.” Big Government, Big Journalism, Breitbart California, antifa, berkeley, NPR, Patriot Prayer, protests"

articles[59] =  "From President Trump to George Zimmerman to Antifa, the Democrat Party and its media have surrendered all claims of the moral high ground on the issue of due process and have even embraced (as long as it is against the correct people, meaning everyone from neo-Nazis to Trump supporters) violent vigilantism. Then — like something out of Robocop or Demolition Man — there is the issue of how those who call themselves progressive and liberals cheer on corporations that have seized control of how Americans communicate and how those corporations have used that control to censor us. Case in point, a headline I never thought I would read at the left-wing Guardian: The far right is losing its ability to speak freely online. Should the left defend it? Keep in mind that this is the same Guardian whose editorial board just last week cheered the decision to “censor the Internet.” The issue, in this specific case, involves Stormfront and the Daily Stormer, two white supremacist websites booted off the internet by their web hosts. Now that no one will host these racist sites, the Daily Stormer has been forced to retreat to what’s known as the Dark Net, which makes it inaccessible to most everyone. But as the Guardian points out, this corporate censorship is not just taking place against neo-Nazis. Twitter and Facebook have become the 21st-century versions of Ma Bell, or the telephone (in other words, the primary means by which Americans communicate with one another) and both sites have become notorious censors and scolds. Under the guise of “hate speech” and the demonic media’s ever-expanding definition of the “alt-right,” today’s Ma Bells are always monitoring your phone calls and warning you not to say “this” or “that” under the threat of cutting your telephone wires altogether. The lazy conservative argument is that “a corporation has every right to run itself as it pleases.” In a perfect world, yes. But conservatives should also oppose monopolies when a corporation becomes so large, overwhelming and necessary that you have no place else to go. How many websites would be lost without the ability to promote its posts on Facebook or Twitter? And then there is the matter of the Daily Stormer. If corporations band together and choose to ban you from the Internet, you lose your ability to exist. Moreover, there actually is a conspiracy afoot… The Silicon Valley robber barons and the media are scheming to continue to expand the definitions of hate speech and the alt-right to include opinions and people they do not like. For example, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) is the tip of this spear, an organization the establishment media takes seriously for only one cynical reason — because it gives them the cover they so desire to label those of us who do not hold the “correct” views on immigration, gay marriage, affirmative action and the welfare state, as part of the neo-Nazi brotherhood. And by extension, this makes the traditional conservatives and Christians part of the neo-Nazi brotherhood. See where this is going? And it is happening in ways big and small. The media and left not only cheer on campaigns that target a right-leaning site’s advertisers, which in turn gives corporations another form of veto power over speech, they express no outrage when corporations fire individuals over their personal political views. How can a freeborn American enjoy the spirit of the First Amendment when mega-corporations are given the power to destroy and disappear us? We can’t. But do we really want to give neo-Nazis a platform? Yes — yes, we do. Hey, I’m a Roman Catholic married to a Mexican. You think I have any love for white supremacists like the KKK? Or Marxist supremacists like Antifa? Or the black supremacists in Black Lives Matter? Or the Hispanic supremacists in La Raza? Or the Islamic supremacists in CAIR? Or the cultural supremacists at CNN? They are all sides of a single coin. But they all should enjoy the right to spew their toxic beliefs. The left used to understand that the only way to secure all of our speech was to defend the vilest of speech. Once you start adding asterisks, the toothpaste is out of the tube.

One “source close to the administration” seemed more than concerned that Don Jr. would help ensure that his father remains in touch with what concerns his “movement.” “Don Jr. is a huge problem,” Buzzfeed’s “source close to the administration” reportedly said. “He needs to be a galaxy away from that place.” As Joshua Green pointed out in his book Devil’s Bargain, reading Breitbart News articles helped Trump understand what concerned working-class voters and never lose touch with them during the primary season and general election campaign. In fact, as Green noted, “an analysis of ‘Trump’s campaign tweets showed that Breitbart was far and away his primary source of news’”: Years before Trump took on all of the same forces that tried to ram through the Gang of Eight’s amnesty legislation, Trump, according to Green, “was reading Breitbart articles flagged by Bannon and then printed out on paper (Trump’s preferred medium for reading) and delivered to him in manila folders by his staff.” Green notes that “by the time Trump entered the presidential race in June 2015,” Breitbart News’ reporting on illegal immigration’s impact on American workers, corporations gaming the guest-worker visa system to displace American workers with foreigners who are not more qualified, the existential threat of radical Islam, and the “excesses of political correctness” had done “much to shape Trump’s populist inclinations and inform his political vocabulary.” Green writes that the site’s “unapologetic and take-no-prisoners style of reporting” appealed to Trump.

articles[61] = "Last weekend anti-mass migration protestors marched against the current Canadian migrant crisis, which has seen thousands of mostly Haitian nationals penetrating the border from the United States. During the protest, Antifa members started a riot, attacking anti-mass migration protesters, police and a camera crew from Canadian broadcaster Global News. The group — which Breitbart News has profiled previously — has since claimed credit, and promised more attacks on journalists in the future. On the Antifa website ‘MTL Counter-info‘ an anonymous poster took credit for the attack, writing: “Sometimes, it is necessary to go against what the mainstream considers ‘acceptable’, to break the law in order to do the ethical thing.” PICS: Leftist Torch German Police Vehicles in Hamburg Anti-G20 Protest https://t.co/hMSrf64mNB — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 28, 2017 The author claims that corporate media are the enemy because they “exist to propagate and reaffirm a capitalist worldview, and regularly hand over their footage to police without even waiting for a court order.” The article admits that many of the actions of Antifa activists are illegal, but claims police trying to hold them to account for their actions is “repression.” Only media “trusted” to blur out the faces of activists committing illegal acts are allowed within the confines of Antifa protests, according to the author.

In Germany, where the group originated as a paramilitary wing of the Communist Party, Antifa has enjoyed a large presence in several major cities for decades. After the G20 riots in which hundreds of police officers were injured, many have called for the government to finally address the lawlessness of the group, who attack right-wing politicians and routinely cause vandalism and destruction.

articles[62] =  "What is most revealing about the book’s excerpt is that she admits that when Donald Trump was “looming behind” her during one of the presidential debates, she wanted to “ask everyone watching, ‘Well, what would you do?’” If Clinton authentically wrote these words herself, it shows that she truly is someone who instinctively wants to do whatever a poll says is the “right thing to do”—whether it is deciding where to go on vacation or which sports team to support. If her political inner circle urged her to write those carefully-crafted words and then suggested that be the first excerpt to be released as part of a broader public relations campaign that will again try to remake her image, it displays her team’s cluelessness about how the public perceives Clinton. While Bill Clinton had top-tier talents like Dee Dee Myers, James Carville, and Paul Begala advising him, Hillary Clinton somehow got stuck with minor-league hacks like Mark “I didn’t think caucuses were important” Penn and Robby “Pajama Boy” Mook for her two presidential runs. Voters view Hillary Clinton as a calculating politician who stands for nothing and will do or say anything to get elected. That’s why she has had trouble finding a coherent message or theme in both of her presidential runs. On Wednesday, Phillippe Reines, who played Trump in Clinton’s debate-prep sessions and is one of her top advisers, appeared on MSNBC’s The Beat with Ari Melber and was asked, “in a sentence or two,” what Clinton’s 2016 message was. “I think her message was simply that there is more work to do, that we’re on a great path, but there is much left to be done … and she knows how to get it done,” Reines rambled, apparently still confused about what the campaign’s core message was. Not quite “Make America Great Again.” Here’s part of Clinton’s book excerpt that she released to Morning Joe earlier this week: ‘This is not okay,’ I thought. It was the second presidential debate, and Donald Trump was looming behind me. Two days before, the world heard him brag about groping women. Now we were on a small stage, and no matter where I walked, he followed me closely, staring at me, making faces. It was incredibly uncomfortable. He was literally breathing down my neck. My skin crawled. It was one of those moments where you wish you could hit pause and ask everyone watching, ‘Well, what would you do?’ Do you stay calm, keep smiling, and carry on as if he weren’t repeatedly invading your space? Or do you turn, look him in the eye, and say loudly and clearly, ‘Back up you creep. Get away from me. I know you love to intimidate women, but you can’t intimidate me. So back up.’ I chose option A. I kept my cool, aided by a lifetime of dealing with difficult men trying to throw me off. I did, however, grip the microphone extra hard. I wonder, though, whether I should have chosen option B. It certainly would have been better TV. Maybe I have overlearned the lesson of staying calm, biting my tongue, digging my fingernails into a clenched fist, smiling all the while, determined to present a composed face to the world.

articles[64] =  "However, the Times offered no such examples of racially charged language. The story itself, by Cathleen Decker, suggested that what was “racially charged” was Trump’s call for “law and order” and his hint at a pardon for former Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Decker wrote that “even as he sought to dismiss one racially fraught controversy” — Charlottesville — “[Trump] ignited another with words that seemed to promise a pardon to Arpaio.” Arpaio, who was recently held in criminal contempt of court, has been accused of racism for his harsh treatment of illegal aliens and for profiling Latino drivers in traffic stops. She later added: Trump’s defense of his own words and his repeated suggestion that it was time to return to law and order carried the whiff of past campaigns, such as those carried out by George Wallace, the late segregationist presidential candidate and governor of Alabama. Wallace, who had been a Democrat (a fact Decker curiously neglected to mention), was hardly the only politician to have campaigned on a “law and order” platform. Notably, Bill Clinton made those themes part of his successful run for president in 1992. The Times story remained the lead into Wednesday, but the headline had been toned down on the website. “In charged speech, Trump rails against media and the GOP,” it read, removing the reference to racially charged language from the headline — but not from the article itself.

articles[65] =  " An article in the New York Times praises “the moral voice of corporate America,” talking up C.E.O-led efforts to “rebuke” President Trump following the Charlottesville controversy. The article hilariously quotes PepsiCo board member and Ford Foundation President Darren Walker, who says he and other corporate figures are “speaking truth to power.” The forthright engagement of these and other executives with one of the most charged political issues in years — the swelling confidence of a torchbearing, swastika-saluting, whites-first movement — is “a seminal moment in the\nhistory of business in America,” said Darren Walker, the president of the Ford Foundation and a board member at PepsiCo. “In this maelstrom, the most clarifying voice has been the voice of business,” he said. “These C.E.O.s have taken the risk to speak truth to power.” Meanwhile, progressive bastion Vox.com published another article. Unlike the New York Times, they are more critical of “corporate morality.” They also go further than the Times in declaring that the corporations of America are starting to fulfil the role previously served by Christian churches. Instead of choosing religions based on their sets of values, argues Vox, we now pick corporations instead. Corporations across the political spectrum have taken an outsize role in identity formation, functioning the way, say, a church service or other ritualistic gathering once did. A well-meaning left-wing college student might choose to spend her money on companies whose values align with her own, choosing to buy her sandwich from Starbucks (or, more likely, an independently-run, sustainable, fair-trade equivalent) instead of Chick Fil-A. But every time she goes there, or tweets her support of this or that brand, she reinforces her own identity, both to herself and others, as a member of a group with particular and specific values. So, too, the right-wing “free speech” activist, who may choose to patronize censorship-free platforms like the chat application Discord, or use, as the Daily Stormer did, hosting platforms like Cloudflare. Critics of either set of behaviors might dismiss either set of spending choices as “virtue-signaling”: the process of performing “good” behavior to achieve a higher status within a given targeted group. But, in practice, the reinforcement the company provides — demanding the spending of money as a ritualistic as well as transactional act, fostering communal interactions with its fans on social media — is less unilateral. It’s not just virtue-signaling, but virtue-creating. In the weird world of corporate morality described by Vox, a consumer’s choices are no longer determined by how good a product is (anyone who says a Starbucks sandwich is tastier than the Chick-Fil-A Spicy Deluxe is lying to you, by the way), but by the political values that the product is associated with. Businesses, meanwhile, no longer serve “the consumer,” but political tribes. It might work for Starbucks, with its relentless focus on the “woke college student” demographic, but it’s harder to see how such an approach will work for companies whose products cut across political demographics. Pepsi is just as popular with Trump supporters as it is with Trump opponents (perhaps more so, given the regular “healthy eating” crazes of Metropolitan types). What happens when the former group catches on to the fact that their consumer choices are funding progressive virtue-signaling? A more dangerous prospect for corporate America is that they all follow the herd, leaving the “non-woke” marketplace wide open for competitors. Just as FOX grew to dominate America’s ratings due to its willingness to embrace conservative viewpoints its competitors despised, if just one or two corporations were to break ranks with the anti-Trump groupthink of their peers, they would win the loyalty of millions. The problem for corporate America is that their virtue-signalling has diminishing returns: as more corporations jump on board the bandwagon, it looks less like bravery and more like opportunism. Meanwhile, any corporation that does swim against the tide will appear daring. The New York Times notes that Apple and Disney seized the initiative in the 1990s to promote LGBT rights — a daring move for the times, which enabled them to stand out and cement their cool, progressive image. A similar opportunity is now opening for corporations whose consumers live not in the East Village but in places like Scranton and West Virginia. It’s true that the latter have less disposable income. But as the Democrats learned last election, there are quite a lot of them. The great danger, of course, is that internet freedom may be killed before the corporate groupthink fades. America’s most progressive companies are based in Silicon Valley. Indeed, they are so progressive that they are willing to pull their services from white supremacists while allowing Islamic supremacists free reign. Those who applaud these companies for taking on Neo-Nazis miss the point; to their most radical employees, everyone to the right of John McCain is a Neo-Nazi. Following GoDaddy and Google’s refusal to host the Daily Stormer, news emerged that Canadian conservative website The Rebel Media had also lost access to a hosting provider. PayPal, after initially going after VDARE, went on to suspend Islam critics Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer from their service. Although both were later restored, their initial suspensions leave us in no doubt as to the direction of censorship on web platforms. And such is the dominance of these platforms, that if you lose their favor, it is much the same as being expelled from the entire internet. Little wonder that conservatives are calling for Google to be regulated like a public utility. As Breitbart’s John Carney has explained, Corporate America is now lining up not just against Trump, but also against the movement that put him in office. This is a clarifying moment in American politics. The confederacy of the media institutions, the American left, and Corporate America has aligned itself against the populist uprising that brought Trump to the White House. The battle lines are clear. If corporations are the new religions, then sectarian strife is on the way.

Stelter said: “Questions that feel out of bounds, off limits, too hot for TV. Questions like these: Is the president of the United States a racist? Is he suffering from some kind of illness? Is he fit for office? And if he’s unfit, then what?” “This brings me back to the questions that are tough to ask out loud on national television,” the host continued. “Is the president of the United States suffering from some sort of illness? Is he racist? Is he fit to be commander-in-chief? And one more, is it time for objective journalists, I don’t mean opinion folks I mean down the middle journalists to address these questions head on and how do they do it?” Panelist Carl Bernstein, who has been leading the charge on this issue, said reporters needed to get more Republicans in Congress and top intelligence officials “on background” and perhaps “off the record” to smear Trump and his “stability and fitness to be president of the United States.” Brinkley, the liberal historian, added that Trump is a “neon billboard” for “overt narcissism” and “malignant self-love.” He further continued to denigrate Trump as a “sick man in the White House.” Big Government, Big Journalism, Bob Corker, Carl Bernstein, CNN, Donald Trump, Douglas Brinkley"

articles[68] = "Lemon was speaking to Sarah Posner, the former Mother Jones reporter who interviewed Breitbart News executive Steve Bannon during the 2016 election at the Republican National Convention. In a quote that has been taken out of context, Bannon, referring to economic nationalists and not ethno-nationalists, told her that Breitbart News was a “platform for the alt-right.” Lemon told his viewers that Bannon told the reporter that Breitbart News was a platform for the “alt-right,” white supremacy, “neo-Nazi[s].” Bannon never did such a thing. The left-wing reporter did not inform Lemon that she emphasized in her own story that Bannon described his ideology as “nationalist” and not “racist” “white nationalism.” Bannon has always described himself as an America-first economic nationalist and rejected ethno-nationalism, most recently telling the American Prospect magazine’s Robert Kuttner that ethno-nationalist “clowns” need to be “crushed.” Bannon has also told numerous other outlets that he has never supported “ethno-nationalism.” “I’m an economic nationalist. I am an America first guy. And I have admired nationalist movements throughout the world, have said repeatedly strong nations make great neighbors,” Bannon told the Wall Street Journal in 2016. “I’ve also said repeatedly that the ethno-nationalist movement, prominent in Europe, will change over time. I’ve never been a supporter of ethno-nationalism.” An extensive Harvard/MIT study found, as reported in this weekend’s New York Times magazine cover story, that Breitbart News is “not alt-right.” And Breitbart News has previously explained why Bannon’s quote–because of the media’s ignorance, laziness, or maliciousness–has been taken out of context: In a Facebook post that may be even more relevant now about the various definitions of “alt-right,” YouTube star Paul Joseph Watson wrote in November of 2016 that the media like to obsess over a “tiny fringe minority” who had “no impact on the election” and just “likes to fester in dark corners of sub-reddits and obsess about jews, racial superiority and Adolf Hitler.” Watson tried to inform the media that the so-called “alt-right” that helped Trump win the White House, as Breitbart News reported, can be “more accurately described as the New Right.” “These people like to wear MAGA hats, create memes, and have fun,” Watson explained. “They include whites, blacks, Asians, latinos, gays and everyone else. These are the people who helped Trump win the election.” The extensive Harvard/M.I.T. study of Breitbart News’ articles and the news ecosystem found that Breitbart News was indeed not “the alt-right” associated with Nazis and white supremacists who have attacked Breitbart News for having been conceived in Israel and its pro-Israel Jerusalem bureau. We shouldn't forget that @BreitbartNews was literally founded in Israel.  https://t.co/mICbMZGqvV pic.twitter.com/QgBScwfXoQ — Richard ☝🏻Spencer (@RichardBSpencer) June 6, 2017 Fox News’s establishment mouthpiece Dana Perino took a page out of CNN’s playbook earlier this week when she too implied that Breitbart News was a site for Nazis. Earlier in the month, CNN purged pro-Trump pundit Jeffrey Lord for mocking Nazis and “Media Matters Facsists” with a sarcastic “Sieg Heil!” tweet even though CNN has not even punished its personalities for defaming Breitbart News as a Nazi site. This is at least the third time that a prominent CNN personality has smeared Breitbart News as a site for Nazis and neo-Nazis, so now there seems to be a pattern at CNN. Here are the other two occasions in which CNN personalities have falsely maligned and smeared Breitbart News: In November of 2016, anchor Brooke Baldwin, after airing a video of a Nazi salute that Breitbart News never published, said on the air that Breitbart News was “the most prominent platform” for what “we just showed, you know, the video we just showed, the Nazi salute, the while supremacists in this country. Are you okay with having Steve Bannon as the chief strategist at the White House, Paris?” As Breitbart News noted at the time, “Breitbart News has never showed the video of the Nazi salute, which ran at The Atlantic and other sites. Nor has Breitbart News ever associated with white supremacists. In fact, earlier on Tuesday, the Daily Beast had reported that Breitbart News had ‘excoriated’ a white nationalist who had reached out to the site.” Furthermore, as Breitbart’s Joel Pollak noted, “Trump had no reported connection with the group in the video, and later disavowed its support explicitly.” On July 18, New York Times columnist and frequent CNN guest Charles Blow said the panel was not going to talk about “what that Breitbart crowd is, and that it is basically Neo-Nazism and the like. I mean we’re not going to bring that part up, anyway.” Video of blow’s remarks is below. Nobody from CNN even challenges Blow’s smear in the video. A search of the transcript that CNN posted of the 9 p.m. ET edition of Cooper’s show on July 18 reveals that nobody ever challenged Blow’s smear. Neither Baldwin nor Blow apparently even got a slap on the wrist for defaming Breitbart News as the “most prominent” site for the Nazi salute and the home for Neo-Nazis.

articles[69] = "“On the morning of Donald Trump’s inauguration, Keval Bhatt hunted through a closet in his parents’ Virginia home for the darkest clothes he could find,” CNN reports. “The 19-year-old didn’t own much in black, the color he knew his fellow protesters would wear head to toe on the streets of Washington that day.” “I thought, there’s a very good chance that I might get arrested, that my whole life could be radically altered in a negative way if I kept driving, and I was really close to turning around,” Bhatt told CNN. “But I think the rationale is that even if it did negatively affect my life, I had still contributed to this movement that was necessary. I was still making an effort to make other people’s lives better, even if it made my life worse, and once I realized that, I had no regrets.” Bhatt, who was arrested, is used as an introduction to the people who identify as the Antifa movement, which CNN reports is not the same at the Democrats or other liberals who support them. Antifa, according to CNN, “has come to represent what experts who track these organizations call the ‘hard left’ — an ideology that runs afield of the Democratic Party platform and supports oppressed populations as it protests the amassing of wealth by corporations and elites.” CNN also speculates that Antifa is a grassroots organization that lacks central leadership, although it has been documented by Breitbart News that powerful Leftists, including George Soros, are funding protests and protesters. Describing those protesters as anti-Trump on “society’s fringe” – including illegal aliens and transgender people – they embrace violence. “Antifa leaders admit they’re willing to physically attack anyone who employs violence against them or who condones racism — as long as force is used in the name of eradicating hatred,” CNN reports. CNN also notes the connection between Antifa and Nazi Germany, even if the media outlet and many others characterize people who are targeted by Antifa as the ones with Nazi sympathies. “Anti-fascists and the black bloc tactic originated in Nazi Germany and resurfaced in United Kingdom in the 1980s. Large numbers of Antifa activists first appeared in the United States at anti-World Trade Organization protests in 1999 in Seattle, and then more recently during the Occupy Wall Street movement,” CNN reports. Citing their involvement in the riots in Berkeley, California, where Milo Yiannopoulos and Ann Coulter did not speak as planned because of violence, CNN reports that “white nationalists, neo-Nazis and others — who have been blamed for provoking violence at last week’s ‘Unite the Right’ rally in Charlottesville, Virginia — claim it was Antifa groups that first got aggressive.” A woman was killed when a man drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters in Virginia. CNN reports that Antifa members have been involved in violent clashes across the United States and around the world, including in Chicago, Philadelphia, Houston, Alabama, and Nebraska and at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany. “Antifa is impossible to track,” CNN reports, noting that “very few” were willing to take their masks off during interviews and that it took “months” to find those who would “share their stories.” CNN concludes that the people who Antifa targets describe themselves as “alt-right” and are inspired by Trump, who they say instigated violence during his presidential campaign by calling out protesters that showed up at his rallies. Atifa, according to CNN, claims their violence is “self-defense” against “hate speech” and people with whom they disagree. “It’s a position taken by many Antifa activists: ‘This is self-defense,'” CNN reports. “Antifa activists often don’t hesitate to destroy property, which many see as the incarnation of unfair wealth distribution” and “sometimes launch attacks against people who aren’t physically attacking them,” CNN admits. Scott Crow, a longtime Antifa member, said: “Don’t confuse legality and morality. Laws are made of governments, not of men,” quoting John Adams. “Each of us breaks the law every day,” Crow said. “It’s just that we make the conscious choice to do that.” CNN reports Antifa memebers use Facebook to organize their protests or counter protests and take martial arts classes and “strategize” on how to achieve their goal of “taking down fascists.” Members of a Portland-based Antifa group “don’t apologize” for the violence, according to CNN. “You have to put your body in the way,” the group’s leader said, “and you have to make it speak in the language that they understand. And sometimes that is violence.” Big Government, Big Journalism, Antifi, CNN, Nazis, peace, violent protesters"

Pelosi said it’s too early to judge Trump on the response to tropical storm Harvey. “We haven’t seen it. He’s been gracious, he went to Corpus Christi, which is sort of appropriate for him to do, because in the heart of the storm. It would be a challenge to accommodate a president,” Pelosi said, adding that she is worried about Trump’s proposed cuts to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in his fiscal year 2018 federal budget. “You can’t do that,” Pelosi said, adding that the issue will be on the table when Congress reconvenes in just a few days. After the violence perpetrated by Antifa activists in recent weeks, Pelosi finally issued a statement condemning them and told the Denver Post violent acts should be “prosecuted.” “I think if there’s some people who are acting in a violent way, that they should be prosecuted,” Pelosi said. “I don’t care who they are, where they are, whatever organization they belong to.” “You’re talking (about) some individuals,” Pelosi said. “You’re not talking about the far left of the Democratic Party — they’re not even Democrats.” “A lot of them are socialist or anarchist or whatever,” Pelosi said. “Violence by anybody is to be rejected and dealt with, but that’s not who we are.” Pelosi said she vows to “fight the Republicans on what they want to do on the tax bill” and praised Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper and Ohio Gov. John Kasich for their healthcare proposal. Pelosi also said Democrats running in upcoming elections should not “worry” about her future as a House leader. “I just say to people, ‘Just win your election. Don’t worry about me; you just win your election,’ ” Pelosi said, while acknowledging that Republicans have used her as an issue on the campaign trail. “She suggested that Democrats should turn the question around and ask whether Republicans will support House Speaker Paul Ryan,” the Denver Post reported. “When Republicans pose that question,” Pelosi said, “you know they’re talking about their own political bankruptcy.” 2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Big Journalism, antifa, Denver Post, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), obamacare, President Donald Trump, tax reform"
articles[71] = "It is what Trump’s victory said so clearly about the MSM’s inability to influence public opinion and, by extension, the outcome of elections. What has also remained unspoken is the media’s desperate and dangerous reaction to this waning influence. As a 25 year media-watcher, I have never seen anything close to the propaganda campaign the national media launched to defeat Donald Trump last year. It was 24/7, it was coordinated across every news outlet, it was all-hands-on-deck. And Trump still won. Which can only mean that the media’s influence has eroded to a point where, despite hurling every kitchen sink available, they suffered a humiliating loss last November. Before I get into the grit of the nit, it is important to keep in mind that our media is nothing more than the communication branch of the Democrat Party. When you look at everything the media does — the lying, the campaigns of personal destruction, the fake news, the focus on stuff like Melania’s shoes — this explanation is the only one that makes sense. The media is a full-blown leftwing political operation run, for the most part, by former Democrat operatives like Jake Tapper, George Stephanopolous, and Chuck Todd, as well as those related to Democrat operatives. Knowing that, and knowing the long history of leftwing regimes (Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Chavez, Castro), we know what a leftwing political operation does when its influence begins to diminish. Because their ideas are so unappealing and are proven failures, the left ultimately has no choice but to embrace violence and censorship. This truth is as old as the Bolshevik Revolution, and this is exactly what we are seeing unfold today in our own country. Rather than politicians, though, it is our media that has turned dangerously militant. Rush Limbaugh is absolutely correct, the Democrat party is dead. Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, the party’s two supposed leaders, are non-entities. From top-to-bottom, the party is a feckless pile of incompetence. Knowing this, the media has told Schumer and Pelosi to hold their beer as they seize the levers of power in the leftwing cause. As a result, the media has used billions of corporate dollars to launch a propaganda campaign to unseat Trump and to keep the divisive issue of identity politics thriving. Naturally, this rabid pursuit of so-called  “social justice” is meant only to serve what has always been the overriding goal of leftwing tyrants: control of our lives through a centralized government. Nevertheless, this represents the least of our media’s sins. The media campaign to censor and silence the political right, most especially on the college campus and online, is being waged on two fronts: through the ever-expanding definitions of “hate speech” and the “alt-right,” and through large corporations. At this point, pretty much every conservative position on abortion, homosexuality, border security, the police, affirmative action, immigration, terrorism, etc., has been labeled as hate speech by the establishment left and many in the media. Moreover, the holding of these beliefs makes you an automatic member of the “alt-right,” which aligns you with white supremacists. Now that this phase is in place, now that mainstream conservative and Christian beliefs have been toxified as hate, whether they are already aligned with the media or because they have been bullied by the media into joining the cause, the mega-corporations that now control our primary means of communication — the public square that is the Internet — are instituting a wave of  censorship. Hiding behind the media’s absurdly expanded definition of hate (or fake news), America’s Googles, Facebooks, Twitters, advertisers, and Web servers are blacklisting conservatives, banning populists, and outlawing their ideas. People are being disappeared from the public square or, out of fear of being disappeared, they no longer feel comfortable to speak freely. The violence comes, of course, from the media’s personal army of Brownshirts, the leftwing terrorists in Antifa. Just like Hitler’s henchmen, Antifa spreads out across the country to violently silence speech that the left does not want heard. And it is not only against neo-Nazis in Charlottesville. Almost all of the chaos, rioting, and violence waged by Antifa over the past two years has been against everyday Trump supporters, everyday Republicans. To encourage Antifa’s wave of violent suppression, our media either ignores and downplays their crimes, promotes their cause as righteous, blames their violence on Trump and his supporters, compares them to heroic World War II soldiers, or in the case of NBC’s Chuck Todd, attempts to legitimize this violence against the political right.

articles[72] = "The Kansas City Star tried to make Kobach disavow Breitbart for alleged “white nationalism,” but he instead denounced organizations like the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) for propagating this “slander” against a diverse newsroom that has been conclusively debunked by textual analysis from Harvard and MIT. From The Kansas City Star: Kobach, a candidate for Kansas governor who is running on a platform of combating illegal immigration, published his first article for Breitbart.com in June — a piece that tied refugees to terrorism. He has published six more pieces since then and more are on the horizon. Kobach, who previously hosted a talk radio show in Kansas City, said Breitbart approached him about writing a regular column in June. “I think Breitbart.com appeals to anyone who is Republican or conservative in any way,” Kobach said after disputing claims that the site caters to white nationalists. “It appeals to a broad spectrum of conservative readers.” … “I find that criticism to be completely baseless and if Breitbart had any connection to white nationalism I would not write for the site. And the Southern Poverty Law Center regularly slanders organizations and individuals … and accuses them of having connections to white supremacy,” said Kobach, who has long faced accusations of extremism from the organization. Read the rest of the story here. The public confirmation of Kobach’s deal with Breitbart brought a flurry of nuclear-hot takes from liberals of all stripes: Kobach is a white nationalist, Kobach is a Nazi, Kobach is leaking voter data to Breitbart (?), etc. So, he's a paid Nazi shill, awesome 🏻‍♀️ @KrisKobach1787 #ImpeachTrump #Breitbart #FridayFeeling https://t.co/2gMnEjGB7Z — 🔥Tara Dublin 🔥 (@taradublinrocks) September 1, 2017 Bannon, Breitbart, Cambridge Analytica, Kobach requesting voter info.

During the rally, Bell condemned his opponents as Nazis, which Carlson said was inciteful and said was “peddling hate.” Reportedly, there were violent incidents during the rally. For Bell’s participation in that rally, Carlson called on Bell to apologize, which Bell has not. Partial transcript as follows: They hate this country, they want to tear it down. They are totalitarians and their beliefs, and in their aims. Even if they didn’t use violence, Antifa would still be illegitimate, and a threat to America. None of that seems to matter to Kamau Bell. He’s happy to stand up on stage and called his opponents Nazis. That’s not a label used on people you want to debate. It’s a label used to incite rage. He had to know how this would end. He did it anyway. And the days since, Bell has not apologized. On Twitter, he issued a statement saying, he wants a world safe for, quote, “Black people, brown people, LGBT people, immigrants, refugees, Muslims, Jewish people, pagans, Unitarian universalist, Mormons, disabled people, poor people, mentally ill people, all people of color, Sikhs, Palestinians, homeless people, Houston people and all people affected by the hurricane. Climate change scientist, public school teachers, freedom fighters, people caught up in the criminal justice system over some b.s., minimum-wage workers, open my curse, and even white people, especially the white allies out in those Berkeley streets today and the white half of my children.” Well, that’s a long list but not everyone, as you’ll notice, got equal treatment. Imagine if we spoke at a rally where right-wingers and masks tried to kill people they disagreed with, Hillary voters, may be. And then afterwards, we issued a statement saying, we were just working on behalf of whites, Christians, gun owners, taxpayers, maybe even some black people, especially those who had voted Republican. How would that go over? This show would be canceled quickly, and it would deserve to be canceled. If you are not willing to say, you want a world safe for all Americans, equally, you are peddling hate, and Bell is. We contacted CNN to see if they had any response to one of their anchor stroking violence extremism as a side gig and they have not responded so far.

Marco Rubio (R-FL), Cory Gardner (R-CO), and John McCain (R-AZ) for standing up to Trump. As Breitbart News’ John Hayward noted, Messrs.

Bannon called Kuttner because he saw in him an ally on trade policy, but the left-wing editor’s past criticisms of Trump’s North Korea rhetoric also made headlines. Last week, Kuttner wrote that “the risk of two arrogant fools blundering into a nuclear exchange is more serious than at any time since October 1962.” Yet, Scarborough and his panel, which consisted of the usual suspects like Willie Guest, Katty Kay, and Eugene Robinson, spent nearly eight minutes droning on and on about how Bannon had called Trump a “blundering fool” to Kuttner when Bannon did no such thing. It took Axios political reporter Jonathan Swan, who has been elegantly and efficiently promoting anti-Bannon spin of late, to correct the ignorant panel. “I just do want to correct one thing that the panel was saying,” Swan said after Scarborough finally brought him into the discussion. “It wasn’t actually Bannon that was calling Trump the arrogant fool. It was the author of the piece.” If Scarborough is not illiterate, he could have been acting with malice to lie about what Bannon did not say. Or, like many of his panelists, Scarborough could just be a poseur–the type who reads a few snippets and excerpts of a book or a long-form article before a dinner party and acts like he has read the whole thing while conversing with other guests who mistake sounding “smart” for having actual knowledge.

The green dots show schools with Confederate namesakes, the blue dots show courthouses that have Confederate monuments/statues, and the red dots show “parks, trails, monuments, municipalities, holidays, buildings, flags” that are maintained. CNN then lists states that are heavy with Confederate symbols, citing Virginia as “the state with the most Confederate symbols [at] 223.” It adds that “Texas, Georgia, North Carolina, Mississippi, South Carolina and Alabama each have more than 100 Confederate symbols each.” The same activists President Trump labeled the “alt-left” can use this information as they search for state and city leaders prone to capitulation.

articles[80] =  "But support for the president’s claim has come from an unlikely source: the “failing” New York Times, which interviewed one of those “very fine” people for an article otherwise critical of Trump, arguing that his remarks have led to a widening split in the Republican Party. The Times reported Wednesday evening: ”Good people can go to Charlottesville,” said Michelle Piercy, a night shift worker at a Wichita, Kan., retirement home, who drove all night with a conservative group that opposed the planned removal of a statue of the Confederate general Robert E. Lee. After listening to Mr. Trump on Tuesday, she said it was as if he had channeled her and her friends — all gun-loving defenders of free speech, she said, who had no interest in standing with Nazis or white supremacists: ”It’s almost like he talked to one of our people.” Conservatives like Ms. Piercy, who have grown only more emboldened after Charlottesville, believe that the political and media elite hold them and Mr. Trump to a harsh double standard that demands they answer for the sins of a radical, racist fringe. They largely accept Mr. Trump’s contention that these same forces are using Charlottesville as an excuse to undermine his presidency, and by extension, their vote. Anecdotally, reports of other, similar individuals have been circulating online. On Tuesday, Trump condemned the white supremacists, KKK members, and neo-Nazis in the Charlottesville protest, but he also said that some people who were not extremists were there to voice a legitimate grievance against the removal of the statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee. He said: You have some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people on both sides. You had people in that group — excuse me, excuse me — I saw the same pictures as you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of, to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name. Those remarks were construed by Trump’s critics and opponents as saying that some of the white supremacists, KKK members, and neo-Nazis were among the “very fine people.” Joel B.

The country had just opened up to the West after four decades of abject poverty and misery, most of them under the tyrannical Stalinist dictator Enver Hoxha. Albania was a prison state akin to North Korea. People who tried to escape were shot; food was meager; the cities were polluted and uglified with dreary communist architecture; everyone looked gray and miserable; freedom of speech was, of course, forbidden: there were spies everywhere and political prisoners ended up in jail or worse… When I arrived, on what I believe was the second ever commercial flight allowed into the country from the West since the war, there was absolutely nothing to do in the country’s dreary capital Tirana except get drunk on incredibly cheap Skanderbeg brandy or visit the city’s one tourist attraction: the National Museum. The National Museum — which we were all forced to see by our official guide whether we liked it or not — was largely dedicated to Albania’s role in the Great Patriotic War. What you and I would call World War II. Now I’m very interested in World War II. I’ve read dozens of books on the subject and I’m fascinated by every last detail: the tactics, the strategy, the uniforms, the hardware, the personal experiences of the men and women who were there… But even for a war buff, this was too much. Room after room after room in this enormous, warehouse-like museum consisted of weapons (small arms, mostly) from the Great Patriotic War. On and on it went, as if what Albania’s Communist partisans did from 1939 to 1945 was the ONLY thing in the country’s entire history that mattered. Which, as far as the Communist regime was concerned, it was. Albanian history prior to Enver Hoxha — the era of King Zog, for example — had simply been airbrushed out of the country’s record books. Albanian history after the Great Patriotic War scarcely got a look in either because, hey, what history are you ever going to be capable of making when your economy is frozen in aspic by your Stalinist regime and your only engagement with the Western world is shooting up passing British naval ships? Why do I mention all this? Because the game Communist Enver Hoxha played in Albania and the game Stalin played in the Soviet Union during and after the Second War War was exactly the same game the regressive left is playing now. It’s a game whereby, according to their warped rules — which they invented — you can imprison or immiserate or tyrannize or even murder as many people as you like with impunity, because however awful you are, it’s OK because you’re not Hitler. The people on their side of the political argument — first Occupy, then #blacklivesmatter, now Antifa: all of them in fact just different incarnations of the same, hard-left Black Bloc insurgency — have done some very ugly, violent, dangerous things and are certainly no friends of Western liberal democracy. But whenever they’re in any danger of being shown up for the nasty, freedom-hating, totalitarian thugs they are, they just use the same distraction technique that Hoxha and Stalin and other evil leftists have used for decades: “Everyone who disagrees with us is Hitler.” This line has become such a commonplace of modern leftist propaganda it has become a meme:  Jonah Goldberg discusses this in some detail in his book Liberal Fascism. It wasn’t because of their dissimilarities that the Nazis and the Communists so hated one another, but rather — see the bitter split between the People’s Front of Judaea and the Judaean People’s Front — because they had so very much in common. (The red in the Nazi swastika flag was a reflection of the party’s Socialistic leanings). The reason that today we think of Hitler’s National Socialists and other fascistic movements as belonging to the right rather than the left is, Goldberg demonstrates, because Stalin branded them that way. Any rival movement of which Stalin disapproved — and that included everyone from Roosevelt’s Democrats to Trotsky — he branded “fascist.” So every time a left wing person today spits out the term “fascist” and imagines that they are taking the moral high ground — what he or she is actually doing, unconsciously — is acting like just another useful idiot of a vicious, bloodthirsty, ruthless dictator who was responsible for killing millions more innocent people than even Hitler did. Donald Trump has understood this perfectly well in his measured and reasonable responses to Charlottesville. A politician of lesser conviction would have done what the likes of John McCain and Mitt Romney are doing in the U.S. and which politicians including Prime Minister Theresa May and Communities Secretary Sajid Javid are doing in Britain. Neo-Nazis: badAnti-Nazis: goodI learned that as a child. It was pretty obvious. — Sajid Javid (@sajidjavid) August 16, 2017 No, not the same. One side is racist, bigoted, Nazi. The other opposes racism and bigotry. Morally different universes. — Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) August 16, 2017 Virtue signaling through the medium of fatal dishonesty, in other words. It’s depressing enough when the regressive left plays this game. But when self-professed conservatives follow suit, we should really start to worry. After all, the idea that organized groups of masked thugs with baseball bats and pepper spray should be given a free pass to do as much damage as they like, be it vandalizing statues or attacking people, just because they claim to be fighting against Nazis or against fascism ought to be offensive to the intelligence of anyone with even half a brain. Yet the entirety of the MSM, vast swathes of our political class, and a significant chunk of the public appears to have fallen for it. This isn’t just a sign of how gullible and/or ill-informed many people are, thanks to a combination of poor education, endless brainwashing, and relentless media bias. It’s also an indication of how fragile our civilization is and how vulnerable to the lies of the extremely well-organized and dangerous left. Being opposed to Antifa is no more a sign of being pro-Nazi than being opposed to Stalin automatically meant you were pro-Nazi.

Durham County Sheriff Mike Andrews said in a facebook post his office is working to identify all individuals involved. Late Tuesday, deputies arrested 22-year-old college student Takiyah Thompson, alleging she climbed the ladder and placed the rope around the monument. “I’m tired of white supremacy keeping its foot on my neck and the necks of people who look like me,” Thompson said during a news conference. “The statue glorifies the conditions that oppressed people live in, and it had to go.” According to ABC11, Thompson is a member of the far-left “Communist-platform Workers World Party and a student at N.C. Central University.” The Workers World Party issued a statement Monday, calling Charlottesville — an event that attracted just a couple hundred people — the watershed in the united struggle against fascism: The events in Charlottesville will long be remembered as a watershed in the developing movement to tear down the walls of white supremacy and all forms of bigotry and unite the popular forces fighting for a better world. The people are showing by their actions that only by taking the fight for justice into their own hands, with no confidence in the organs of state power, can they make progress. On Aug. 14, youths in Durham, N.C., tore down a Confederate statue with their own hands, expressing their fury at the murder in Charlottesville. Long live the independent struggle of this new progressive movement against the fascists, the cops and the capitalist establishment! The Durham crowd, according to the Herald-Sun, additionally included members of the Triangle People’s Assembly, Industrial Workers of the World, Democratic Socialists of America, and Antifa. More arrests are expected. Monday’s events are representative of the growing radicalization of America’s left. Alissa Ellis, of the Workers World Party, told the Herald-Sun that now is the time for people to embrace multiple tactics. “‘We need to shun passive, white liberalism,’ she said, the kind that elevates white voices over brown and black.” Black Lives Matter, another leftist movement that emerged in 2013 after the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, called Monday for all Confederate flags, statues, and groups to be illegal in the U.S. After WWII, Germany outlawed the Nazis, their symbols, salutes & their flags. All confederate flags & statue, & groups should be illegal. — BLMChicago (@BLMChi) August 14, 2017 Last year, the Southern Poverty Law Center counted more than 1,500 items in a “far from comprehensive” study “to catalog and map Confederate place names and other symbols in public spaces.” Their findings include monuments, schools, military bases, county and city names, and holidays — all targets to be removed, changed, or destroyed — and it appears Charlottesville has accelerated the efforts. On Monday, Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh pledged that she would remove four Confederate-related monuments. According to the Baltimore Sun, however, this “wasn’t enough for some members of the Baltimore City Council, who said statues recognizing Confederate leaders should be destroyed, not moved.” “These people were terrorists,” said City Councilman Brandon Scott. “They were traitors. Why are we honoring them?” By Tuesday, just a day later, “in a stealth purging of history, the city of Baltimore removed [the] four Confederate statues from city property under cover of night,” Breitbart reported. “It’s done,” Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh said. “They needed to come down. My concern is for the safety and security of our people. We moved as quickly as we could.” Officials in Lexington, KY, Memphis, TN, and Jacksonville, FL among others have also vowed to accelerate efforts to remove Confederate monuments. In Georgia, the fight is zeroing-in around Stone Mountain Memorial, a giant carving of three Confederate Civil War generals on the side of a mountain that took nearly 50 years to complete after the project began in 1923. Democrat candidate for Governor Stacey Abrams released a statement calling for the destruction of the 158-foot-long bas-relief, which depicts Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Generals Robert E.

These images symbolize a time of racial discrimination and segregation that continues to haunt this country and many African-Americans who still to this day face racism and bigotry,” Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-MI) said in a statement to The Hill. The leftist activists and Democratic politicians calling for the removal of memorials to Confederate war dead and the statues of Confederate leaders have made no distinction between them and other monuments to American history. Many of the founding fathers owned as many or more slaves as the civil war-era leaders whose images they are calling to erase. American veterans of the Revolutionary War, War of 1812, and Mexican-American War, not to mention the Union soldiers of the American Civil War, all fought to defend a country that had the institution of slavery. On Tuesday, President Trump pushed back during a press conference saying, “This week, it is Robert E. Lee. I noticed that Stonewall Jackson is coming down.

articles[84] =  "In a press conference ostensibly called to discuss the president’s infrastructure plan, journalists badgered Trump with questions about his response to the attack in Charlottesville, during which one woman was killed and another 19 injured when a man deliberately drove his car into a crowd of protesters. “There was no way of making a correct statement that early,” the president said of his initial response to the attack, which many observers characterized as insufficient condemnation of white supremacy and extremism. “Unlike you and unlike the media, before I make a statement, I like to know the facts.” The president also lashed out at the media for its “inaccurate” reporting surrounding the incident, and said that blame for the violence at the protest belonged to “both sides.” In response to the press conference, NBC’s Chuck Todd said he was “shaken” by what he had seen, according to CNN’s Brian Stelter. \"What I just saw gave me the wrong kind of chills.

articles[85] =  "In the main lobby of Trump Tower in New York City, the president grew combative after a throng of reporters started shouting questions about why he “waited” to specifically condemn neo-Nazis and white nationalists. “There was no way of making a correct statement that early,” he said, defending his first statement on Saturday before the facts were in. “Unlike you and unlike the media, before I make a statement, I like to know the facts.” As reporters grew more agitated, Trump continued defending his decision and condemning the media for their one sided reporting. Trump again denounced racist elements among the protesters, including people supporting the KKK, neo-Nazis, and white nationalists, but clarified that some of them did not identify with the most extreme elements in the crowd. “I’ve condemned neo-Nazis. I’ve condemned many different groups,” he said. “But not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch.” Reporters demanded to know whether the driver of the car that injured counter-protesters and killed a woman in the crowd was a domestic terrorist. “I think the driver of the car is a disgrace to himself, his family and this country,” Trump replied. “The driver of the car is a murderer. What he did was a horrible, horrible, inexcusable thing.” Trump also condemned what he called the “alt left” demonstrators that charged into the crowd of alt-right protesters without a protest permit. “Do they have any semblance of guilt? What about the fact that they came charging with clubs in their hands, swinging clubs? Do they have any problem?” he asked. “I think they do.” Trump described the day as “horrible,” but reminded reporters that there were “two sides to a story.” “I think there is blame on both sides,” Trump said. “I have no doubt about it and you don’t have any doubt about it either, and if you reported it accurately, you would say that.” CNN’s Jim Acosta protested that the “neo-nazis” started the violence by showing up in Charlottesville to protest the removal of a statue depicting Confederate general Robert E. Lee. Trump did not deny that there were “bad people” in the alt-right group but said that there were some protesters who were not white nationalists or neo-nazis that were protesting. Trump dismissed media assertions that he was putting the alt-left and white supremacists on the same moral plane. “I am not putting anybody on a moral plane,” he said. “You had a group on one side and the other and they came at each other with clubs and it was vicious and horrible.” When asked if he spoke with the family of the victim, Trump replied, “I’ll be reaching out.” Big Government, Big Journalism, Charlottesville Virginia, Donald Trump"
articles[86] =  "“When it comes to protecting the speech of people who are most vulnerable to being intimidated into silence — like people of color and gay people — conservatives either are suspiciously quiet or drive further intimidation with wildly negative news coverage,” Taylor writes, arguing that right-wing media only defends speech that it likes. She cites a few examples, most notably, Johnny Eric Williams, an associate professor at Trinity College who was temporarily suspended from his position after a media backlash over concerning comments he made after the shooting of Congressman Steve Scalise. In her column, Taylor conveniently omits William’s offense. After the brutal shooting of Congressman Steve Scalise, Williams took to Facebook and wrote “#LetThemFuckingDie”. “It is past time for the racially oppressed to do what people who believe themselves to be ‘white’ will not do, put end to the vectors of their destructive mythology of whiteness and their white supremacy system. #LetThemFuckingDie,” Williams’ Facebook post read. Around the same time, Williams shared an article of the same name that criticized Capitol Police Officer Crystal Griner, a black woman, for protecting Scalise and other victims of the shooting and then called for minorities to refuse assistance to whites in potentially fatal situations. The post called for those persons to not only watch as others die but to “smile” as they watch, for letting them die is a “great service” to the “universe.” How did Taylor characterize William’s incident? She wrote that Williams “had to go into hiding after the conservative website Campus Reform blasted his use of racially charged language in critiquing white supremacy.” There was no mention of the disturbing remarks that put him in a position of turmoil. Taylor also cited the case of Tommy Curry, an associate professor at Texas A&M, who argued during a podcast that “in order to be equal, in order to be liberated, some white people might have to die.”  Taylor omits Curry’s offense entirely, instead referencing a criticism of his words by the American Conservative, which called them “racist bilge.” Big Journalism, Social Justice, Tech, New York Times"
articles[87] =  "Yahoo! reporter Caitlin Dickson penned a gushing paean Monday for the “secretive movement of combative leftists” who “seek to destroy” “authoritarian movements” with “direct action.” The piece even included a photo of a large group of smiling happy warriors, unarmed and fists raised in righteous indignation at the “white supremacists” they would confront. According to Ms. Dickson, “[A]ntifa’s origins can be traced back to Europe in the 1920s and 30s. Since the end of World War II, antifa activity has ebbed and flowed along with that of neo-Nazis, skinheads and other hate movements that have sprung up around the United Kingdom, Germany and the United States.” In fact, as the avowedly Marxist-socialist periodical Jacobin magazine explains in a much more honest, if not less enthusiastic, appraisal, Antifa, originally known in its native Germany as Antifaschistische Aktion, was founded as the militant wing of the German Communist Party. In the 1930s, it was known to be every bit as violent as its Nazi opponents. After World War Two, Antifa groups re-formed in Germany to collaborate with Soviet communists on subduing the country and rooting out its past to create a new socialist utopia. They were active in Communist-controlled East Germany until that country’s Stalinist leadership got fed up, broke the groups up, and sent many of their leaders to gulags. The modern Antifa is a transnational movement of pale imitators of their communist forebears who have mostly traded class-struggle for “anti-racism” and other vague ideologies that tend to justify violently attacking any group they feel ought not to be able to speak. The modern movement began among squat-dwelling punks in West Berlin and other West German cities in the 1980s and soon had chapters throughout Europe. The Antifa scene in the United States, by contrast, began with the more American-friendly name “Anti-Racist Action” among Midwestern skinheads in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It has grown up recently more than its European counterparts, especially in college towns like Berkeley, California, and cities with bustling punk communities like Chicago, Illinois. Even putting aside Antifa’s prominent role in turning Saturday’s Unite the Right rally into a bloody slog, the Yahoo! piece willfully ignores decades of Antifa tactics and behavior to give this unashamedly violent group an endorsement as the defense against “bolder neo-Nazis.” “They prefer direct action: They pressure venues to deny white supremacists space to meet,” Dickson writes, neglecting to mention that “direct action” to Antifa means smashing people in the face with bike locks, spraying elderly men with bear mace, sending reporters to the hospital when they film them, and then bragging about it online, all because people with different opinions than theirs are allowed to speak, or simply be, in public. In Europe, where self-proclaimed anti-fascist crews have been a major feature of the continent’s street politics for decades, gatherings of right-leaning groups there, including Britain’s UKIP, Germany’s populist AfD party, and the continental Identitarian movement, have come to expect to come under attack from Antifa. When not the subject of national news attention, Antifa groups are even more wantonly violent. In 2012, as many as 18 Antifas from Bloomington, Indiana, the University of Indiana’s college town, busted into a family restaurant in Tinley Park, Illinois, a southern suburb of Chicago, because they heard a meeting of a tiny organization called the Illinois European Heritage Association. Unprovoked, the men smashed up the restaurant and attacked diners and employees, including those with absolutely no connection to the European Heritage Association lunch with clubs, crowbars, and batons. Only five of the assailants were ever caught and charged. Not one snitched on his fellow Antifas, and all served several years in prison. They are still regarded as heroes in the Antifa community, known as the Tinley Park Five. Other Antifa blogs on both sides of the Atlantic, which Breitbart News will not link to for decency’s sake, routinely post braggadocios reports of their members seeking out lone individuals or small groups they believe are Nazis and macing or beating them to a pulp with clubs. Not to worry, Ms. Dickson assures us–interspersing her article with mirthful tweets from celebrities about white nationalist “alt-right” leader Richard Spencer being punched in the face by a masked antifa. The group is only “willing to use violence in order to fight white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and others they deem to be ‘fascists.'” In reality, Antifa’s definition of a “fascist” can, and often does, encompass virtually anyone not a member of their gang, including some on the mainstream left. “Liberals get the bullet too,” for example, has become a not-entirely-ironic slogan of the movement. People and groups designated “fascists” — and therefore subject to unprovoked Antifa violence — include not only Richard Spencer and his ilk, but, in no particular order, former Breitbart News Tech Editor MILO, his readers, Trump supporters, other Trump supporters, members of Germany’s populist AfD party, a 20-year-old woman who chose to wear a Spanish-flag bracelet, a Philadelphia free speech rally, former UKIP and Brexit leader Nigel Farage, libertarian VICE News co-founder Gavin McInnes, French policemen, and Israeli-owned bookstores. Interesting, a Salafist Muslim who attacked a “filthy white” Antifa writer because he disrespected Islam does not qualify.

We always condemn ourselves.” Stewart went on, “Not that some of these groups are our own people, but for some reason, we feel obliged to apologize for these neo-Nazis and these KKK guys. We have nothing to do with them.” “But the left is very, very smart,” he added, “They never apologize for Antifa.

articles[89] =  "Mr. Dennard, who served as the Director of Black Outreach in the George W. Bush White House, reacted with anger as Boykin attempted to race-shame him. Allegations of “Uncle Tom” behaviour are often hurled by left-wing activists as a means to silence or shame minorities who lean conservative. Recently, the phenomenon spread to Muslims or ex-Muslims who find their political allegiances on the right of the political spectrum. Despite the network hosts earlier urging Ken Cuccinelli to apologise for telling another contributor to “shut up” during a discussion, anchor Brooke Baldwin made no attempt to get Boykin to apologise for his on-air racism. Speaking about the Charlottesville violence, Boykin baited Dennard, stating: “I’m ashamed that you as an African-American, Paris, will not say [that President Trump has not done enough].” Dennard began to respond: “Keith, I don’t need you to try and pull my black card. I am well aware of my blackness and don’t need you to try and classify me as being one.” At this point, Boykin interjected, “Are you?” calling Dennard’s blackness into question. “Keith, don’t go there,” responded a visibly perturbed Dennard. “Do not go there. I know what it means to be a black person in this country. I have experienced racism on a regular basis, by being a Trump supporter, and by being a proud American who happens to be a Republican. I get racist comments about my family, about my mother, about my girlfriend, about my character every single day and mostly coming from black people.” Boykin then condescended Dennard, telling him to “calm down” over the racist remark. “I won’t calm down,” said Dennard. “I will not be attacked by you about my blackness because I happen to be a Republican.” Earlier in the day, the network asked Republican Ken Cuccinelli to apologise to Bernie Sanders supporter Symone D.

articles[91] =  "According to the Cook Political Report’s David Wasserman, things are not looking good for Democrats: Even if Democrats were to win every single 2018 House and Senate race for seats representing places that Hillary Clinton won or that Trump won by less than 3 percentage points — a pretty good midterm by historical standards — they could still fall short of the House majority and lose five Senate seats. Wasserman attributes this partially to Republican gerrymandering and Democratic voters’ clustering in urban areas, which he says, “has moved the median House seat well to the right of the nation.” Timing and a “terrible Senate map” for Democrats are also to blame, he says. While Democrats must defend 25 of their 48 seats in 2018, Republicans have just eight of their 52 seats up for grabs. Another problem for Democrats that Wasserman points out is Democrats hold far more Republican seats on, what he calls, “borrowed time”: Democrats hold six Senate seats from the 26 Republican-leaning states — all six of which are at risk next year. This bad news for Democrats goes well beyond 2018, the report says. “[T]here’s a larger, long-term trend at work too — one that should alarm Democrats preoccupied with the future of Congress and the Supreme Court.” In the last few decades, Democrats have expanded their advantages in California and New York — states with huge urban centers that combined to give Clinton a 6 million vote edge, more than twice her national margin. But those two states elect only 4 percent of the Senate. Meanwhile, Republicans have made huge advances in small rural states — think Arkansas, North and South Dakota, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana and West Virginia — that wield disproportionate power in the upper chamber compared to their populations. By quantifying the partisan bias of Congress over time, “by measuring the distance between each national presidential result and each year’s presidential result in the median House and Senate seats”, Wasserman shows that today the pro-GOP bias in both the House and Senate are at historic highs. According to the report, the last time the Senate had such a strong Republican bias was in 1913 — the year direct Senate elections were ratified. While their odds don’t look good, there may still be hope for Democrats in 2018. They did, after all, win back control of both chambers in 2006, despite a GOP bias that year. However, it’s definitely a long-shot, Wasserman says, citing the 2010 scenario in which Democrats were able to obtain 60 senate seats, enabling them to pass Obamacare. What did it take for the party to be able to obtain 60 seats? The Iraq War, Hurricane Katrina and a stock market crash, which generated a huge backlash against President George W. Bush and Republicans in 2008. Today, it would take even more cataclysmic events under GOP rule to propel Democrats to a supermajority over the next six years. While it is still early in the cycle, one Republican Senate seat at risk of being lost to the Democrats is Dean Heller’s Nevada seat. Elected in 2012 with just 46 percent of the vote, Heller is the only Republican senator up for re-election from a state Clinton won last year. He is being targeted from both the right and left and has even been confronted by President Trump over his unease with the GOP’s Obamacare repeal effort.

articles[93] =  "Liberals only wish. Last week, the president joined Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and David Perdue (R-Ga.) to announce legislation that would make seminal changes to our immigration laws for the first time in nearly half a century, profoundly affecting the entire country. The media have chosen not to cover the RAISE Act (Reforming American Immigration for Strong Employment). This bill is their worst nightmare. Instead of admitting immigrants on the basis of often specious “family” ties, the bill would finally allow us to choose the immigrants we want, based on merit, with points granted for skills, English proficiency, advanced degrees, actual job offers and so on. Most Americans have no idea that we have zero say about the vast majority of immigrants pouring into our country. Two-thirds of all legal immigrants get in not because we want them — or even because Mark Zuckerberg wants them — but under idiotic “family reunification” laws. The most important provision of the RAISE Act would define “family” the way most Americans think of it: your spouse and minor children. Unfortunately, that’s not how the Third World thinks of “family.” In tribal societies, “family” means the whole extended clan — adult siblings, elderly parents, and brothers-in-law, plus all their adult siblings and elderly parents, and so on, ad infinitum. Entire tribes of immigrants are able to bully their way in and, as legal immigrants, are immediately eligible for a whole panoply of government benefits. Suddenly, there’s no money left in the Social Security Trust Fund, and Speaker Paul Ryan is telling Americans they’re going to have to cut back. At some point, American businesses are going to have to be told they can’t keep bringing in cheap foreign labor, changing the country, and offloading the costs onto the taxpayer. But that’s not this discussion. Business owners want cheap workers — not the disabled parents of cheap workers. In a sane world, merely introducing such an important bill — with the imprimatur of a president elected on his immigration stance — would force the media to finally discuss the subject they have been deliberately hiding from the public. Has Trump personally endorsed any other legislation like this? He harangued congressional Republicans on Twitter to pass some Obamacare replacement, but he never endorsed a specific bill. But, you see, there’s a reason the media don’t want to talk about immigration. With a full public airing, Americans would finally understand why recent immigrants seem so different from earlier waves, why income inequality is approaching czarist Russia levels, why the suicide rate has skyrocketed among the working class, and why all our government benefits programs are headed toward bankruptcy. As Stephen Miller, the president’s inestimable speechwriter, said, some legislative proposals “can only succeed in the dark of night” and some “can only succeed in the light of day.” This is a light-of-day bill. So, naturally, the media refuse to mention it, except to accuse Miller of being a white nationalist for knowing hate-facts about the Emma Lazarus poem not being part of the original Statue of Liberty. (It’s the Statue of Liberty, not Statute of Liberty, media.) They ignore this bill so they can get on to the important business of Trump’s tweets, who’s up and who’s down in the White House, and Russia, Russia, Russia. According to my review of Nexis archives, there was only a single question about the RAISE Act on any of the Sunday morning shows: Chris Wallace’s last question to his very important Republican guest. Unfortunately, his very important Republican guest was amnesty-supporting nitwit Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who sniped about Trump employing foreign guest workers at Mar-a-Lago. However that may be, guest workers have absolutely nothing to do with the RAISE Act, which, as Miller heroically tried to explain to clueless reporters, concerns only green-card holders, i.e., lawful permanent residents — not guest workers, not illegal aliens and not a poem Scotch-taped onto Lady Liberty in 1903. At least the media aren’t deluded about the popularity of their position. Discussing immigration is a total loser for them. They know what they want is not supported by anyone. Low-wage workers don’t want hundreds of thousands of low-skilled immigrants being dumped on the country every year. Employers don’t want the deadbeat cousins of their cheap workers. Americans on public assistance don’t want foreigners competing with them for benefits. Boneheaded Scandinavian communities that welcomed refugees don’t want to turn their entire town budgets over to various foreign tribes. In a recent Numbers USA poll of voters in 10 swing states with vulnerable Democratic senators up for re-election next year, only 22 percent of respondents thought immigrants should be allowed by right to bring in “family” other than spouses and minor children. Make the senators vote, Mr. President! Donald Trump was elected president, beating the smartest, most qualified woman in the world, by proposing to put Americans first on immigration. This bill makes good on that promise. There’s a reason the media won’t discuss it. If Trump were smart, he’d talk about nothing else.

articles[94] =  "The emails Breitbart News obtained and published demonstrate how Davenport—who is colluding with the head of a government union representative for EPA employees—is aiming to cultivate leakers against President Trump and his EPA administrator Scott Pruitt. In other words, Davenport is digging for dirt on Trump and Pruitt and is seeking to activate a legion of leakers to help her get it. Times spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades-Ha told Breitbart News in response to the Davenport email that it “demonstrates the process of reporting and gathering facts.” Rhoades-Ha went even further in a statement to the Hollywood Reporter on the whole episode: “Stories like this can have a chilling effect on precisely the type of investigative journalism that holds government power to account.” Many in media like to claim—falsely—that they are objective and do not take a side in reporting and writing. That is just plain false, and what Davenport’s email more importantly demonstrates—something that is painfully obvious based on the actual content of it—is that she is looking for facts and information that can be weaponized against, with the intent to hurt, President Trump and Administrator Pruitt. What these Davenport emails clarified—and demonstrated with evidence—is something patently obvious but extremely revealing about the media: They prove the point that she is taking a side in the information war. She’s not asking for information that would help Pruitt or Trump or conservatives or Republicans, nor hurt or expose Democrats or Gore or leftists who believe in climate change. Or, put another way, the New York Times thinks cultivating deep state saboteurs is journalism. A quick stroll through Davenport’s byline at the Times shows a clear point of view on the issues she covers. Most of the stories she writes for the Times help leftists and progressives, and hurt conservatives and the Trump administration. For instance, last month she interviewed former Vice President Al Gore about climate matters. “Talking About Climate Change With Al Gore,” was the headline for that piece, which contains no critical lines about anything Gore has done. It includes a video of Davenport’s interview with Gore. It refers to Gore glowingly as a “Nobel Prize-winning climate change activist.” Compare that to pieces she has written about Republicans, and particularly Trump administration officials. The day before her Gore interview posted, Davenport filed from Morgantown, West Virginia, this headline about Energy Secretary Rick Perry and clean coal: “Perry Praises ‘Clean Coal,’ but Trump Administration Policies Don’t Promote It.” On that piece, right there in the headline, she rips Perry and criticizes the Trump administration, including Pruitt and the president. Her Times piece, largely citing “some experts” from MIT and the leftist Brookings Institution, argues that there are “contradictions” between what Trump, Perry, and Pruitt say and what they can do. Or look at her coverage leading up to President Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris Climate Accords. For months, she hammered Trump with headlines like “Top Trump Advisers Are Split on Paris Agreement on Climate Change,” “What Trump Can and Can’t Do to Dismantle Obama’s Climate Rules,” “Trump Lays Plans to Reverse Obama’s Climate Change Legacy,” “Policy Advisers Urge Trump to Keep U.S. in Paris Accord,” “Trump Administration Delays Decision on Leaving Climate Pact,” “World Leaders Increase Pressure on Trump to Stay in the Paris Accord,” and “World Awaits Trump Decision on U.S. Future in Paris Accord.” A scroll through her byline on the New York Times website shows no reporting or headline from Davenport on all the people who were urging the president to withdraw from the Paris deal to protect American workers’ jobs throughout the rust belt and in the energy industry. Or what about a piece from Davenport about how the president delivered on his campaign promise to withdraw from the deal? Places like CNN, the Washington Post, and yes, the New York Times, consistently claim as a defense for what they do: “objectivity.” They claim they do not take a side on the information battlefield, and despite occasionally throwing the other side some crumbs to build their credibility, they clearly do take a side in the fight. Therein lies the main reason why Breitbart News’s reporting on this matter—and the publication of Davenport’s emails seeking to cultivate leakers—has Davenport’s buddies throughout the leftist media triggered. New York Times White House correspondent Glenn Thrush fired off a series of nasty tweets about Breitbart News’s piece. First, Thrush bashes Breitbart News as a “Trump-allied outlet funded by anti-regulatory conservatives” and says that Breitbart News “should be” “very afraid” of Davenport.

But if this is such a nothing-burger of a story, why are so many in the media going to such great lengths to fight back against it and the revelations within? The reason is because shining a light on the process of how the media operates–again, there is nothing abnormal about what Davenport is doing–begins to pull the veil back on how what former Breitbart News national security editor and deputy assistant to the president Dr. Sebastian Gorka has correctly called the “Fake News Industrial Complex.” Others in the White House, including former Breitbart News executive chairman and White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon–as well as President Trump himself–have called the majority of these people in the media the “opposition party.” Bannon, at the beginning of the administration in February, just after Trump took office, infamously mocked reporters lined up in the White House: Steve Bannon walks by a large group of reporters camping out, says to us, \"The opposition party, all lined up.\" — Francesca Chambers (@fran_chambers) February 15, 2017 In addition to all of the above, another reason the media is so triggered by Breitbart News’s publication of these Davenport emails is because the Breitbart News piece on them listed the names of government employees at the EPA whom the union organizer Davenport was colluding with encouraged to become anti-Trump leakers. In other words, their sources–or potential sources–were outed, making it more difficult for them to achieve their objective. Interestingly, in later commentary, even people like Thrush and Wemple seem to understand all of that–though they only admit it in the most derogatory of ways. By publishing recipients of email, Bannon's protege is behaving as a tool of administration–to intimidate whistleblowers. Like State Media. https://t.co/1T7Z1d69VX — Glenn Thrush (@GlennThrush) August 8, 2017 Breitbart seeks to chill NYT sources, assist EPA in possible leak investigation: https://t.co/kb815YtW6b — ErikWemple (@ErikWemple) August 8, 2017 In fact, in the full article Wemple felt compelled to write about this Breitbart News story, he spends hundreds of words whining about it before getting to the real point in the final two paragraphs: Were this tract merely a piece of Breitbartian, conspiracy-driven media criticism, that’d be fine. But it’s more than that. Read Boyle’s entire story; after he hammers Davenport for seeking information on how Pruitt is running the EPA, he notes that O’Grady forwarded Davenport’s email to a number of EPA employees who might be interested in providing information to her. So what, right? Well, Breitbart is here to provide the extraordinary public service of listing names — more than 30 — to which the email was supposedly forwarded. Nice move, Breitbart. You’ve scolded the New York Times, possibly stifled its sources and assisted the Trump EPA with a potential leak investigation, all in one post."
articles[95] =  "Mathis-Lilley speculated that “it makes sense that Breitbart … would think that the worst thing it could possibly reveal about H.R. McMaster is that he has a thirdhand connection to a Jewish guy.” Klein had reported that McMaster had been involved with the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). His investigation turned up the fact that IISS received funding from the Soros-backed Ploughshares Fund, though it had not listed Ploughshares on its website. Soros is a well-known and controversial left-wing billionaire who spends his fortune to influence politics in a variety of countries, including the United States. The idea that any criticism of Soros could be presumed to be antisemitic is absurd. Ben Mathis-Lillet makes his claims against Breitbart by citing innuendo about the “alt-right.” Slate’s attempt to protect McMaster using empty accusations of antisemitism is a sign of desperation — and is, of course, ridiculous. Aside from the fact that Breitbart News is not an “alt-right” website, and that it was founded by Jews and is largely managed by Jews, Mathis-Lilley and Slate left out a number of other crucial facts:  Mathis-Lilley, who was fired by BuzzFeed in 2014, is no stranger to antisemitic jokes: @jbasher @shani_o Up high! Down low–Jew slow! — Ben Mathis-Lilley (@BenMathisLilley) April 19, 2013 Perhaps Slate should question its chief news blogger about evident enthusiasm for antisemitic “humor.” The far-left and establishment media outlets have rushed to defend McMaster, with some attempting to paint negative coverage of him as extremist smears instead of legitimate concern over his worldviews, especially on Iran. McMaster has been accused of purging the National Security Council of hardliners on Iran, and he is seen as a leading proponent of the Iran nuclear accord within the Trump administration. McMaster has reportedly urged the Trump administration to recertify Iran’s compliance with the Iran nuclear deal. The Soros-funded progressive activist group Media Matters for America has attacked conservative media for raising questions about McMaster. Think Progress has gone so far as to claim that the campaign against McMaster has been led by “white supremacists.”  Think Progress is affiliated with the Center for American Progress, which was founded by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign chairman, John Podesta. “Why Is the Alt-Right Attacking H.R. McMaster?” Newsweek asked, glossing over the significant issues with McMaster.

articles[97] =   "Sunday on Fox News, Katrina Pierson, one of President Donald Trump’s top allies, said that Miller “reeducated” Acosta on the difference between “illegal immigration” and “green cards” as Acosta tried to inappropriately “editorialize” during the televised press conference. She said she sent miller a “fist-bump text message” after Miller’s press conference. After finding out about Pierson’s remarks, Acosta tweeted: “Definitely put me down as not ‘reeducated.'” Definitely put me down as not \"reeducated.\" https://t.co/LOBvmta82Z — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) August 6, 2017 Apparently lacking self-awareness, Acosta also claimed last week that Miller just could not take the “heat” and implied that he won the exchange with Miller. During his much-publicized exchange, Miller exposed Acosta’s “cosmopolitan” biases by calling out CNN’s spotlight-seeking reporter after Acosta implied that only newcomers from “Great Britain” and Australia speak English: Jim, I just got to say, I am shocked by your statement, that you think that only people from Great Britain and Australia would know English. It reveals your cosmpolitan bias to a shocking degree that in your mind … this is an amazing moment … that you think that only people from Great Britain and Australia would speak English is so insulting to millions of hard-working immigrants that do speak English from all over the world. As Breitbart News’ John Carney pointed out, Acosta was indeed clueless as “the U.S. has recent immigrants from more than 20 countries outside of Britain and Australia where English is the official or dominant language. These include a large number of Caribbean nations, such as Barbados, Bahamas, Jamaica, and Antiqua-Barbuda. Two English-speaking African countries, Liberia and Zimbabwe, also send a number of immigrants to the U.S.” Miller also called Acosta out after Acosta railed against Trump’s proposed border wall and claimed that immigration was at a historical low while seemingly unaware of the difference between “illegal immigration” and America’s “green-card policy”: You don’t actually think the wall affects green card policy? You couldn’t possibly believe that could you? Actually, the notion that you actually think immigration is at a historic low. Do you at CNN really not know the difference between green card policy and illegal immigration? Acosta also seemed to claim that the Emma Lazarus’ Statute of Liberty poem determined U.S. immigration law, an obnoxious claim that Miller promptly swatted away: I appreciate your speech, so let’s talk about this. In 1970, when we let in 300,000 people a year, was that violating or not violating the state of liberty law of the land? In 1990s, when we let in half a million people a year, was that violating or not violating the law of the land? Tell me what years meet Jim Acosta’s definition of the Statue of Liberty per law of the land. You’re saying a million a year is the Statue of Liberty number — 900,000 violates, 800,000 violates it.

articles[98] =   "“Media in support of President Donald Trump are calling for the ouster of Trump’s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, accusing him of being a ‘globalist’ ‘traitor’ who is ‘aligned with the enemies of Trump and America,’ ” Media Matters wrote on its website on Friday. Media Matters, founded by Hillary Clinton ally David Brock, titled its article “Fake news purveyors, Twitter trolls, and Sean Hannity go all in against national security adviser McMaster.” “Over the past month, McMaster has worked to oust some members of the National Security Council (NSC) who were previously aligned with former national security adviser Michael Flynn and Trump’s chief strategist (and former Breitbart News head) Steve Bannon,” Media Matters wrote. Media Matters also targeted “pro-Trump outlet” Circa News, for reporting that McMaster had sent a letter to former national security adviser Rice, “giving her unfettered and continuing access to classified information and waiving her ‘need-to-know’ requirement on anything she viewed or received during her tenure.” Media Matters argued on behalf of Rice, who it said faced a “dubious accusation” of unmasking Trump officials caught up in surveillance and that “there is no proof Rice did anything wrong.” Media Matters also attacked Hannity, calling him a “Trump propagandist,” for questioning McMaster’s decision on Rice. The article compiles all “conservative” media that have questioned McMaster’s loyalty to the president, including Breitbart News, which reported in January on the efforts by Media Matters to “stop” Breitbart News. “The scheme was documented in a Media Matters briefing book obtained by the Washington Free Beacon at a retreat for current and prospective donors held in Florida,” the Breitbart News article said. “The 14-page pamphlet listed a core budget goal for 2017 of $13.4 million, which the booklet says would pay for a staff of 81, ostensibly to wage war on independent news media outlets like Breitbart,” the Breitbart News article said. “The briefing book focused heavily on Breitbart News, which was repeatedly singled out as a target.” “In one section of the pamphlet, in which Media Matters bills itself as ‘the top watchdog against fake news and propaganda,’ the progressive media activist group falsely claims that Breitbart News ‘provides a nexus point for the so-called alt-right (the newest branding for American white nationalism, anti-Semitism, and misogyny) to exploit vulnerabilities throughout the media landscape.’ ” According to Activists Facts website, Soros and other left-wing groups fund Media Matters for America to the tune of millions: MMfA’s funders range from labor unions to progressive foundations to liberal billionaires. From fiscal year 2009 to 2012, the National Education Association (NEA) has contributed $400,000 ($100,000 per year) to Media Matters. MMfA has received an additional $185,000 from other labor organizations since 2005, making labor unions some of the largest known contributors to Media Matters. MMfA has directly quoted these labor groups and has defended them against “attacks” from reporters and media personalities. MMfA did not disclose these donations in its reporting on labor unions. MMfA has received nearly $30 million from foundations since it started. The Tides Foundation is the largest contributors to MMfA, giving nearly $4.4 million. There are undoubtedly close ties between the organizations besides financial support. MMfA frequently reports on the critics of Tides, but fails to mention that the foundation is MMfA’s largest donor. The line between Tides and MMfA is so blurry that even donors appear to be confused. In 2003, prior to the official launch of MMfA, the Stephen M. Silberstein Foundation even designated a $100,000 contribution to “Tides Foundation – Media Matters for America.” Billionaire George Soros donated $1 million to Media Matters in October 2010. Media Matters also claimed in its pro-McMaster report that the hashtag #FireMcMaster was being promoted on Twitter by various conservative groups.

She then told Chris Cuomo that she had “absolutely no qualms or problems saying that I think this policy is pedaling to racism.” According to Breitbart’s John Carney’s analysis, Trump’s proposal would make working-class Americans wealthier because “the gross domestic product per U.S. resident would grow.” “That’s what he’s done during his entire campaign,” she added later. “That’s what he did when he called Mexican rapists. That’s what he did when he called for the Muslim ban. That’s what he does. He pits one group of Americans against each other in order to make himself feel bigger and in order to appease his base.” Cuomo and Navarro, both of whom are apparently unaware of the debate between whether immigrants should adopt “melting pot” assimilation or “salad bowl” separatism, seemed to take offense that pro-assimilationist Americans would rather have immigrants assimilate than become “hyphenated” Americans who embrace “salad bowl” separatism.

Sarsour, a Palestinian-American, anti-Israel activist, and organizer of the Women’s March the day after Trump’s inauguration, called for “jihad,” or holy war, against the Trump administration last month. Breitbart News reported that Sarsour was speaking in Chicago at the annual conference of the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA), a group that the Investigative Project on Terrorism notes was an “unindicted co-conspirator” in a terror-funding prosecution, and was allegedly “created by members of the Muslim Brotherhood” in the United States in the early 1980s. Quoting the Prophet Muhammad, Sarsour said: “A word of truth in front of a tyrant ruler or leader, that is the best form of jihad.” “And I hope that we, when we stand up to those who oppress our communities, that Allah accepts us from us that as a form of jihad, that we are struggling against tyrants and rulers, not only abroad in the Middle East or on the other side of the world, but here, in these United States of America, where you have fascists and white supremacists and Islamophobes reigning in the White House,” she stated.

The charges against the president include his not mentioning Jews in his statement on International Holocaust Remembrance Day without revealing that the White House responded by saying the statement honored all victims of the Nazis, which included Jews, gypsies, homosexuals and non-Jews. “It is with a heavy heart and somber mind that we remember and honor the victims, survivors, heroes of the Holocaust. It is impossible to fully fathom the depravity and horror inflicted on innocent people by Nazi terror. “Yet, we know that in the darkest hours of humanity, light shines the brightest. As we remember those who died, we are deeply grateful to those who risked their lives to save the innocent. “In the name of the perished, I pledge to do everything in my power throughout my Presidency, and my life, to ensure that the forces of evil never again defeat the powers of good.

articles[101] =  "Instead, the new President of the United States (POTUS) shows an indefatigable commitment to his ‘Make America Great Again’ agenda — which included toughness on immigration, crime, trade, and the border wall. His unwillingness to accept bad deals for the American people will both reassure and further endear him to those that put him in the White House in the first place. AUSTRALIA AND ‘REFUGEES’ Take the Australian call to start, which hinged on the refugee deal, which POTUS consistently disparaged during the call. Prime Minister Turnbull tries to foist 1,250 “refugees” on President Trump, to which POTUS shot back: “Who made the deal? Obama?” Now the media, and indeed Turnbull, originally start these conversations by talking about “refugees”. But during the conversation Mr. Turnbull reveals the truth: They are basically economic refugees from Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. That is the vast bulk of them. So not actual refugees, but economic migrants. And only not allowed into Australia because the Australian government is enforcing its policy of not taking people who arrive by boat. Yet Mr. Turnbull wants President Trump to compromise on the policies he was elected on, the latter of whom asks: “Why haven’t you let them out? Why have you not let them into your society?” Turnbull admits: “It is because in order to stop people smugglers, we had to deprive them of the product. So we said if you try to come to Australia by boat, even if we think you are the best person in the world, even if you are a Noble [sic] Prize winning genius, we will not let you in”. From here on, the conversation goes round in circles. Turnbull wants to save face with his public by not having to renege on Australian policies, but he wants President Trump to do the precise opposite.  Mr. Trump won’t play Mr. Nice Guy though, nor will he play the politician game. His answers are honest and to the point:  We are like a dumping ground for the rest of the world. I have been here for a period of time, I just want this to stop. I look so foolish doing this. It [sic] know it is good for you but it is bad for me. It is horrible for me. This is what I am trying to stop. I do not want to have more San Bernardino’s or World Trade Centers. I could name 30 others, but I do not have enough time. In his discussion with President Peña Nieto, Mr. Trump insists Mexico is going to have to pay for the wall. He talks about the trade deficit the U.S. has with Mexico, and mentions how America would be willing to stop the criminal gangs in Mexico, that Nieto has failed to address. The criticism POTUS is already facing from CNN and the like is the line: “Believe it or not, this is the least important thing that we are talking about, but politically this might be the most important talk about”. But they stop reading the transcript there. President Trump wasn’t speaking about how he doesn’t believe the wall is important, he was talking about the dollar value of it. Finish reading the paragraph, CNN, and be honest. Trump goes on: “But in terms of dollars – or pesos – it is the least important thing. I know how to build very inexpensively, so it will be much lower than these numbers I am being presented with, and it will be a better wall and it will look nice. And it will do the job”. He asked Nieto repeatedly not to publicly refuse to pay for the wall — as the start of a negotiation between the two nations. This is an entirely reasonable position to take, but already the left is trying to claim the President is simply trying to save face. In reality, he’s trying to save capital (quite normal) on the issue, while suggesting Mexico get their heads around having to eventually pay for the wall. In fact he even says that, while the press is trying to pretend he didn’t. He literally said, during the call: “I have to have Mexico pay for the wall – I have to.” In brief, the calls show Trump as consistent, not what the media is pretending them to show.

articles[102] =  "Morning Joe co-host and fake rock star Joe Scarborough begged new White House Chief of Staff John Kelly on Monday to “sideline” White House Chief Strategist Steve K. Bannon because Bannon encourages Trump to attack the “fake news” media and support pro-nationalist policies. Scaraborough was upset that Bannon referred to Scarborough’s elite pals in the media who think he is an actual rock star and has a cool haircut as “the enemy.” He was also apparently furious that Bannon was concerned about the Deep State even though nearly two-thirds of Americans, according to a recent Harvard-Harris poll, believe that there “exists campaign to delegitimize” Trump. Scarborough’s new friends at Harvard also found that a majority of Americans believe the “Deep State” is using leaks to “unseat” Trump. “I hate to keep going back to one of my themes over the past six months, but it so important that Steve Bannon is sidelined. It’s so important that general Kelly sidelines Steve Bannon, who plays to Donald Trump’s worst instincts,” Scarborough told his fellow media elites on Monday. Scarborough is also apparently upset that Bannon actually encourages Trump to attack and defeat Scarborough’s poor friends in the legacy media who have tried to undermine and delegitimize Trump since his historic victory, never giving Trump credit for doing what they all thought was more impossible than Kirk Gibson’s 1988 World Series home run on one leg off of all-world closer Dennis Eckersley. That, to Scarborough, is encouraging Trump’s “worst instincts.” Pobrecita! Scarborough wants to turn Trump into a version of himself, Jon Hunstman, John Hickenlooper, John Kasich or any other candidate who can only win Scarborough’s “No Labels/St. Albans” primary of 378 or so media elites and insufferable “thinkers” and “influencers” who mistake “sounding smart” for actual knowledge. Of course, such a candidate would get clobbered in a general election, which is why Scarborough may want to sabotage Trump and convince him to embrace policies that Trump’s enemies in the “fake news” media support. Scarborough always throws tantrums when Trump keeps his campaign promises. For instance, after Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris Climate Accord, Scarborough almost lost his mind, repeatedly saying “President Bannon” on the air like a maniac even though Bannon has been described simply as Trump’s “soldier” who has always defended Trump—whether it was after Trump’s announcement when Trump attacked illegal immigrants from Mexico or after the release of Trump’s Access Hollywood tapes—when everyone else was running as far away from Trump as possible.
