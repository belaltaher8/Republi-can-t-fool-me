Undoing the harm done by the Iran nuclear deal needs to share the top of the agenda.In mid-October President Trump will bump up against a “certification” deadline imposed by the Iran Nuclear Agreements Review Act. The prompt was intended to ensure a much closer look at Iranian behavior and the Iran nuclear deal known as the “JCPOA.” Instead of sloughing off a threat that makes Hurricane Harvey look like an overflowing bathtub, this oversight duty must be taken far more seriously.Obama’s JCPOA is trumpeted primarily for one alleged achievement: it bought us time. In reality, it did precisely the opposite.  It bought Iran time. Instead of ratcheting up the pressure on Tehran on our terms and our timetable, Americans paid to give Iran time to hone missile delivery systems (Obama omitted from the deal) and get itself to the brink of acquiring a nuclear weapon before the JCPOA’s terrifying hourglass runs out. On August 3, 2017 Iranian President Rouhani said Iran will be able to start enriching uranium to 20% in the Fordo facility in only five days, and reactivate the reactor in Arak because cement was never poured into its core. His remarks were repeated on August 22, 2017 by the head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization, Ali Akbar Salehi.The Iran deal was exceptional for one other characteristic: it claims to put vital aspects of U.S. national security in the hands of non-Americans, the UN Security Council, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and our negotiation partners China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, the European Union and Iran.After all, President Obama went to the Security Council to adopt the Iran deal formally, and purportedly bind the United States in international law, before he took the deal to Congress. The complex regime for reinstating the sanctions that Obama tore up is intended to put American foreign relations in serious jeopardy should we calculate the necessities of our well-being deviate from the calculations of others.President Trump and Congress need to exercise their constitutional responsibility to move the center of gravity back where it belongs.In August, former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton (and Fox News contributor) publicly provided the administration with options.  In July Senators Cotton, Cruz, Perdue and Rubio called for “a sober accounting of Iran's JCPOA violations as well as the regime's aggressive and destabilizing behavior.” So where is it?A third rubber stamp of what candidate Trump called the “worst deal ever” is indefensible. Outsourcing our national security to the U.N. is not a plan.The IAEA has so far produced six reports on Iran’s implementation of the JCPOA. The agency has been careful to indicate, however, its reports are limited by “the modalities set out in the JCPOA.”Moreover, in late August U.N. Ambassador Haley pointed to “military sites” and “undeclared sites” which the IAEA had not asked to inspect – and to which, therefore, it had not been denied access.  Even IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano said in March that he has no idea how many years it will take to conclude that Iran has no undeclared nuclear material and activities – because “it depends very much on the level of cooperation from Iran.”  As recently as August 29, 2017, Iran’s government spokesman Mohammad Bagher Nobakht unilaterally declared military sites off limits.Step back and recall where Obama left off with “certifying” Iran’s good behavior. In November and December 2015 the IAEA issued its final pre-JCPOA reports and found: \"...the Agency is not in a position to provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran, and therefore to conclude that all nuclear material in Iran is in peaceful activities.\" Obama responded by simply shutting down any further investigation of Iran’s pre-JCPOA activities.So now, as then, we still don’t know what we don’t know. What we do know is that the IAEA had already specifically itemized, in 2011 and 2015, Iranian “activities that are relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device…” and “specific to nuclear weapons.”And we also know that the pre-JCPOA certification scam consisted of Iran self-reporting. It reads, for instance: “Iran will provide to the Agency [IAEA] photos…Iran will provide to the Agency videos…Iran will provide to the Agency seven environmental samples…”Moreover, the JCPOA continues to give Iran far more than it does the United States and its allies, since it granted – for the first time – an Iranian right to enrich uranium, and legitimized a regime that had correctly been an international pariah.The windfall that Obama gave the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism, and close North Korean collaborator, via the JCPOA is a sunk cost.  This Congress and this president have no excuses to continue sailing the American people into a storm from which they will never recover.Anne Bayefsky is director of the Touro Institute on Human Rights and the Holocaust.

To judge from the overheated reaction, left, right and Barack Obama agree on this. Color me curious.Once upon a time, we had a government where Congress fulfilled its part in the checks-and-balances system. But gradually, and almost totally on many issues, lawmakers became expert only at ducking and kicking everything to the White House. Because of that bipartisan cowardice, the estimated 800,000 dreamers remained an unresolved issue for many years. Obama said repeatedly he couldn’t solve it, only Congress can write the laws.Then, before the 2012 election, Obama changed his mind and, with a stroke of a pen, stopped deportations. But the “D” in DACA meant deferral, and everybody knew it was temporary and probably unconstitutional.T he “D” in DACA meant deferral, and everybody knew it was temporary and probably unconstitutional. Congress, especially Republicans, was furious, and said it was their job. So now Trump, after zigs and zags, calls their bluff. It’s your job, he said, now do it.That’s what they wanted, and it’s how our system is supposed to work.

He explained that the Constitution does not allow the president the power to unilaterally change immigration law by executive order. Under DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), which was created by an executive order signed by President Obama in 2012, the federal government allowed children brought to the U.S. in violation of the law to get permits so they could stay here legally for two years at a time, with the ability to renew their permits.  President Obama said he issued the executive order because Congress was deadlocked and couldn’t reach agreement to pass legislation to fix our badly broken immigration system. Conservatives rightly assailed President Obama for assuming lawmaking jurisdiction, clearly usurping the constitutional authority of the Congress to pass laws.Even more egregiously, Obama achieved nothing but talk regarding immigration reform when he entered office in 2009 with a solidly Democratic Congress. He instead waited for a politically opportune time before the 2012 election to waive his scepter like a king and pronounced DACA as an edict.On the other side, many Hispanics and immigration advocates now correctly decry the threat of deportation facing Dreamers, who were brought to America by their parents and had no say in breaking our immigration laws.Congress should show heart and smarts through a three-part law that would help the Dreamers and at the same give America a sound immigration policy that serves our nation’s best interests.First, Congress must accede to the president’s insistence on a fully funded wall along our border with Mexico, which was clearly a foundational pillar of his 2016 victory. Our government has an obligation to secure our border.Second, DACA should be turned from an unconstitutional executive order into a law. But is should also be phased out, so that no more immigrants can sign up for the program. It is one thing to allow people already protected by DACA to stay here. It is quite another to make this a permanent program that would incentivize never-ending violations of our immigration laws.And third, the RAISE Act – supported by President Trump and sponsored by Republican Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Sonny Perdue of Georgia – should be approved by Congress. The legislation would transform our present chain-migration system based on relatives already in this country to one based on skills, so that we welcome the best and brightest of the world who also love our values.  Paradoxically, it is President Trump – so roundly and unjustly maligned by the mainstream media as anti-Hispanic – who stands uniquely positioned now to achieve this substantive immigration reform, and on “America First” terms.President Trump has, amazingly, largely secured our border only months into office and empowered U.S. Immigration and Customers Enforcement to accelerate the deportation of dangerous criminal illegal aliens.At the same time, the president clearly aches for the predicament of the Dreamers themselves. So he is in the best position to achieve a long-awaited solution to their uncertain immigration status.Many DACA residents know no other country, speak English as their primary language, work legally and raise children who are American-born.  I disagree with some of my Team Trump brethren who believe these 800,000 residents should be “returned to sender” to their birthplaces. In my view, they comprise a totally different category than adults who willfully broke our immigration laws.So Congress, I hope you enjoyed the August break that you didn’t deserve.

articles[4] = "\n                                     \n                                What happened?! Hillary Clinton obviously left off the question and exclamation marks from her book title, but no worries. If anyone has been confused about what happened last November, things were just cleared up by a simple meme on Twitter. The photo shows a copy of Hillary’s upcoming campaign memoir, “What Happened,” next to another book – titled “I Happened.” The second book cover shows a picture of a grinning President Donald Trump. Simple, funny and most of all, true. But if that answer isn’t enough for Hillary supporters, they have a chance to have Hillary personally tell them a fairy tale, but only if they cough up $150 to nearly $2,400 for tickets and the privilege of seeing her in the flesh.Hillary abandoned her supporters on election night, but hey, why go down to speak for free when you can wait until your book is finished and then charge everyone an arm and leg to hear your excuses for losing?The promotional material for the book tour wants to make sure you know how much of a victim Hillary really is: “She speaks about the challenges of being a strong woman in the public eye, the criticism over her voice, age, and appearance, and the double standard confronting women in politics.”The book tour promo material goes on to talk about the Russians. “She lays out how the 2016 election was marked by an unprecedented assault on our democracy by a foreign adversary. By analyzing the evidence and connecting the dots, Hillary shows just how dangerous the forces were that shaped the outcome.”Oh, so the Russians told Hillary to call half the electorate “deplorable” and “irredeemable?” Got it.            The truth is, in fact, boring and predictable. Hillary lost because of Hillary, including the conspiracy nonsense she peddles promoting “dangerous forces” as an excuse for her desperate inability to be honest and face reality. During the election, Hillary took supporters – and the American people in general – for granted.  And now she’s taking them for a ride. Just ask Democrats in Wisconsin, a state she couldn’t be bothered to visit during the campaign because, as the Borg know full well, resistance is futile.Until it’s not.So don’t fret Milwaukee! You are now on the list as Hillary is deigning to pay you a visit on the book tour. Yes, a year late, but she’s confident in her contempt, and she’s sure you’ll pay her to lecture you.On this day, as Houston is only really beginning to assess the damage of Hurricane Harvey, one wonders who could really use that $150 to nearly $2,400 that Hillary is pocketing for the pleasure of her company. People, their pets, and other animals who need rescuing from a hurricane’s bacteria-laden flood waters? Families who need shelter and food to survive the aftermath? Or a twice-failed multimillionaire politician looking to cash in on her latest fiasco?Tammy Bruce is a radio talk-show host, New York Times best-selling author and Fox News political contributor."
articles[5] = "\n                                     \n                                The most important thing to understand about President Trump's decision Tuesday to wind down the DACA program, which has allowed 800,000 immigrants brought to this country illegally as children to stay here, is just how legally shaky DACA was. Before issuing the executive order creating DACA – which stands for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals – President Obama had repeatedly said he did not have the authority to change immigration law on his own. President Obama then changed his mind. The courts, including the Supreme Court in 2016, enjoined a similar law for adults. Legal scholars predicted DACA would be declared invalid within a year.President Trump's decision to end DACA – but to allow a 6-month grace period so Congress can codify changes in the law that could let so-called Dreamers stay – is being attacked from left and right. To liberals, the president’s move represents the creation of heartless uncertainty. For conservatives, immigration hawk Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, says the president's action will touch off a \"big, civil war\" among Republicans. In reality, the president is this time keeping his cool and navigating the turbulent political waters here prudently.President Trump isn’t keeping the specifics of the DACA order, which grants a two-year renewable work permit to recipients while blocking any deportation actions against them unless a criminal record is involved. But President Trump says he will work with Congress to reach a viable solution.A statement by the president Tuesday echoes DACA supporters in one respect: \"I do not favor punishing children, most of whom are now adults, for the actions of their parents,\" President Trump said.Candidate Trump’s heated campaign rhetoric last year led many people to believe he really did want to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. But his attention-grabbing soundbites were belied by his previous positions on the subject.Back in 2012, when he was mulling over a run for president, Trump told an interviewer he was “probably down the middle” on immigration issues. After his election in 2016, he said he would focus on deporting \"bad hombres\" with criminal records and leave the Dreamers alone while the issue was sorted out. The genius of Trump on the campaign trail was that he sent two different messages on immigration.  On the one hand, he called for a border wall and bizarrely claimed he would get Mexico to pay for it. On the other hand, he said he would build a “big beautiful door” in the wall to let in legal immigrants. He reiterated that stand after the election, when he told a rally that he expected the wall would let in both legal immigrants and guest workers.With his acknowledgement Tuesday that he expected to sign a compromise on the Dreamer issue, President Trump is actually proving himself a good player in the game of the political two-step.  Activists on both sides of the political spectrum are upset, but the vast majority of voters in the middle will probably see it as a reasonable compromise. Of course, members of Congress are already posturing. Rep. Joe Crowley, D-N.Y., is accusing Trump of \"hostage taking\" should the president try to tie Dreamer status to, say, funding for his border wall.  But in the end, the political onus will be on Democrats if they block Dreamer legislation because they refuse to link it to any other issue. If President Trump plays his cards right, his move Tuesday is smart politics. With new guidelines in place that make it easier to deport unwanted or criminally minded immigrants, the president can feel free to be flexible and even generous with other immigrants.  The end result will satisfy neither President Trump’s most fanatical supporters nor his critics. But it is certainly likely to work better than the chaotic status quo on immigration.John Fund is a columnist for National Review. Follow him on Twitter @JohnFund."
articles[6] = "\n                                     \n                                Republicans have not convinced many everyday Americans of the rightness of our cause. So we need to do something different to get our message directly to the American people and explain how the policies we advocate will benefit them.To succeed, it’s time for Republicans to take the initiative and go on the offensive. We need to seize opportunities, streamline the legislative process, become less risk-adverse and not rely on the media to fairly deliver our message.Republicans also need to define issues, employ better arguments and make the Democrats pay a price for their unpopular positions. And we need to be as disciplined in governing as Democrats are in opposing.       Democrats attack. Republicans explain. Instead, Republicans should show the positive impact of our plans on the lives of individuals. And we should use charts, graphics, photos, social media and all the other tools of modern communication. Republicans are too defensive. Democrats are like predators that instinctively pursue their prey as soon as they see their backsides. Republicans should confront our opponents, not head for the tall grass. Republicans shy away from sensitive issues, such as immigration, even when our solutions are popular. For example, few issues garner 70 to 80 percent of the public’s support. But a program called E-verify does. It protects jobs for American workers rather than letting illegal immigrants take them.Other issues involving education, law enforcement, family and individual freedom are winners as well. Republicans should be as hungry for victories now as we were when Democrats controlled Congress.Some congressional gridlock could be reduced by Republicans ourselves.The House spends months on spending bills that will seldom become law and are not particularly liked by conservatives.The Senate allows Democrats to block consideration of hundreds of bills with a filibuster rule that dates back only to 1975, and which could be repealed easily.Republicans also could benefit by thinking of ourselves as bakers. We should realize that a half-loaf, or even a slice, is better than no bread at all. The legislator who refuses to change a word of a bill will never enact a meaningful law. There is rarely a touchdown pass in Congress; usually it’s just grinding out first-downs.There is a tendency, too, for Republicans to vote no: members of our party want time to look before they leap.But it’s wrong to compare what we are voting on with perfection, rather than with the Democrats’ liberal alternative. By only voting for perfect bills, we will pass very little legislation. And Republicans will then be considered part of the problem, not part of the answer to problems facing our nation and our people. That spells electoral disaster.Often Republicans let Democrats determine the terms of debate. Some of the nicer words Democrats use to describe Republicans are “vile,” “heartless” and “killers.”Republicans reciprocate by adopting the Democrats’ own language. For instance, they agree to call the media “mainstream” and Democrats “progressive” rather than the more pejorative term, “liberal.”Suppose Republicans took the initiative, defined issues, expedited the legislative process and became a united team. Would that guarantee success? It might help but, no, it wouldn’t turn the tide.Until Republicans acknowledge the elephant in the room – the need to combat pervasive and relentless liberal media bias – our agenda will languish.As a result, we will not be able to deliver our message because the media primarily give only one side of the story – the other side. Americans simply won’t hear what Republicans are saying. Or, if they do, our work will assuredly be presented in a negative way.For Republicans, the media is like having another self-funded liberal Democratic opponent.George Mason University Professor Tim Groseclose quantified the media’s bias and found that it was worth 5 percent of the vote. His calculation has never been refuted.So without a biased media, we would have had a President McCain, a President Romney, a President Trump landslide, and many more Republicans in Congress today.The media’s intent is to intimidate, silence and put Republicans on the defensive. It’s working. And Republicans are willing accomplices to the media’s manipulation.The threshold question is: Why do Republicans let the media tell us what to think? Why read liberal columnists? Why watch the liberal news? Ignore them!Republicans take the bait. We swallow it hook, line and sinker. When a reporter calls and asks Republicans to comment on the president, legislation, or the Republican Party, many eagerly comply.The result is inevitably an unwarranted and critical story about the divided GOP, our weak leaders or our flawed bills.Why Republicans respond at all – much less answer hypothetical and leading questions – is beyond understanding. It enables the media to influence GOP strategy and policy.As for President Trump, the Republican Party’s fortunes largely rise or fall with him. If the economy grows, if jobs are created, if the borders are secured, if taxes are lowered, Republicans will benefit. But these achievements won’t occur if the president is besieged by his own party and the media.The president has called the media “the opposition.” He has a point. He has received the highest percentage of negative coverage of any recent president.Two-thirds of Americans now think the media are hurting the country! And the media’s credibility is at a record low. Much of what the media report is exaggerated, biased or slanted, if not malicious.The Democratic Party’s enablers spend millions of a dollars on “war rooms” that provide members of the media with tainted information they readily disgorge to savage Republicans.What are Republicans going to do in response? For starters, we should cite examples of media bias in speeches, and in letters to editors and producers. We should form organizations that will educate the public about the facts and dangers of media bias.And we should flood social media with counterpoints to the liberal media and Democrats – the “mediacrats.”Media bias is a threat to our democracy. If the American people don’t get the facts, they can’t make good decisions. And if they can’t make good decisions, our democracy is at risk.For our country’s sake, let’s hope and pray that Republicans will succeed in being able to accurately present our ideas to the American people.Congressman Lamar Smith represents the 21st district of Texas in the House of Representatives and is the chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee."
articles[7] = "\n                                     \n                                North Korea made clear its determination this weekend to keep advancing its nuclear weapons program, conducting its sixth and most powerful underground nuclear test only hours after claiming it has now developed a hydrogen bomb that can reach United States with the potential to kill millions.I doubt the truth of the North’s boast that it has already developed an H-bomb that can be mounted on an intercontinental ballistic missile to wipe out a U.S. city or a city in another nation. But we could see the North achieve this frightening goal soon unless President Trump acts quickly and decisively.Just last month in an opinion piece for Fox News I reported that a Pentagon source told me North Korea was only 6 to 18 months away from developing an H-bomb. My source told me this weekend that he still believes that but added on Sunday morning that “nothing North Korea does now should really make us jump out of our seat. At this point, I rule out nothing.”Yikes.The new North Korean nuclear test and the nation’s claim to have an H-bomb are part of the same strategy. For dictator Kim Jong Un to have confidence in his advanced nuclear weapons and missile delivery system he wants to test them, potentially on several occasions.I would argue that North Korea likely can already hit the U.S. with a crude nuclear delivery capability – now. So it’s an urgent matter of national security for President Trump and his administration to act to contain the nuclear and missile capabilities that Kim already has. So far, despite what Pyongyang has told us, Kim has never tested anything with the destructive power of a hydrogen bomb. Although, North Korea’s test Sunday was the biggest ever – roughly three times the size of its nuclear explosion this time last year and more powerful than the atomic bombs the U.S. dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan in World War II.North Korea would also have to miniaturize any nuclear bomb to mount it on an ICBM. Again, this is something else that would take additional time and would be a big leap for Kim, as well as fit the new weapon onto a missile.But whether it happens in a few months or even two years from, there is little doubt that the North is headed toward possessing the most powerful bomb on the planet and a working delivery system to many parts of the world, including our homeland. I would argue that North Korea likely can already hit the U.S. with a crude nuclear delivery capability – now.  So it’s an urgent matter of national security for President Trump and his administration to act to contain the nuclear and missile capabilities that Kim already has.As a first step, it’s time to pull out all the stops to make sure we restrict the amount of financial resources going into North Korea and make it as hard as possible for Kim to build up his nuclear program and H-bomb designs.The goal of this new action – like the last set of sanctions passed by the U.N. Security Council just weeks ago – should be to limit the amount of money going into North Korea that helps fund its nuclear and missile programs.President Trump needs to act unilaterally to name, shame and sanction any businesses, organizations and governments that help launder money for North Korea or assist the rogue nation in evading past or present sanctions. The amount of laundered money that goes to North Korea could easily amount to billions of dollars a year.This anti-money laundering campaign will undoubtedly hurt China and its banks here in the U.S., but it’s a necessary step to ensure Beijing and Pyongyang understand that evading sanctions that the U.N., U.S. and other individual nations have imposed on the North will no longer be tolerated.Second, we need to massively ramp up our military footprint in the Asia-Pacific region. President Trump should deliver on President Obama’s promise and actually “pivot” or “rebalance” to Asia. This would make Asia our top national security priority outside of the defense of our homeland, no matter what the international crisis of the day is.That means that instead of 60 percent of U.S. naval assets being in the Pacific we should increase that number to 70 percent. These new assets should be a mix of attack and guided missile submarines as well as AEGIS destroyers that can defend against North Korean missile attacks.Third, our land-based missile defenses in East Asia need to be ramped up dramatically as well as at home. We should work quickly with Japan to deploy additional PAC-3 batteries as well as deploy the THAAD missile defense system there as well.Washington should also work to quickly expand the number of ground-based midcourse defense interceptors that we need to defend against a North Korean ICBM attack.On top of this, President Trump should make clear that it is the policy of the United States that we will never accept a nuclear North Korea, and that all options still and will always remain on the table.While Washington will not start a war with Pyongyang, Kim must know we would respond to any North Korean military attack with severe deadly force. And if Kim ever launched a nuclear attack, President Trump should also make clear that the portly pariah of Pyongyang would be signing his and his nation’s death warrant.Today we are paying the accumulated price of having not devoted the required attention to a national security challenge that should have been front and center for every U.S. administration for decades.And while we might not have a perfect plan to mitigate the danger coming from North Korea, we do have many strong options that can collectively keep our nation and our allies secure.Harry J.

Instead of acting as an impartial, honest fact-finder on behalf of the American people, Comey behaved like a partisan hack. The former FBI director’s reprehensible behavior both during and after his tenure surely validates the judgment of President Trump in firing a man totally unfit to oversee our most revered law enforcement agency in our nation.The new evidence is revealed in a letter sent Wednesday to FBI Director Christopher Wray from Republican Senators Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. The letter is a bombshell, and didn’t get anywhere near the media attention it deserves.The evidence disclosed by Grassley and Graham comes from the Office of Special Counsel, a government agency that investigated whether Comey violated the law when he was FBI director. The investigation was closed after Comey was fired. The new evidence shows that Comey drafted a memo exonerating Clinton of wrongdoing as early as April 2016, even though Clinton was not interviewed until July 2016.As Grassley and Graham correctly stated in their letter:  “conclusion first, fact-gathering second – that’s no way to run an investigation.”In fact, after Comey wrote his “nothing to see here” draft absolving Clinton of wrongdoing, the FBI still interviewed a total of 17 key officials. In addition to Clinton herself, State Department Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, who was appointed by Clinton and served under her, was also questioned. Mills received a very unusual immunity agreement from investigators. How is it possible that Comey had ascertained, at such an early date, that the evidence would not incriminate Hillary Clinton? Such a prejudicial judgment certainly reveals a shocking level of bias and a dangerous willingness to engage in partisan politics.Understandably, President Trump reacted to the new evidence with indignation, tweeting Friday: “Comey exonerated Hillary Clinton long before the investigation was over … a rigged system!” Many Americans had already concluded that Comey’s investigation of Clinton was a sham. The majority in a July 2016 Washington Post/ABC News poll disagreed with Comey’s decision to not seek an indictment against her.The American people were poorly served by an FBI director who shirked his duty as a public servant. They thankfully delivered their verdict on Clinton’s suitability for the Oval Office at the ballot box last November.Adding insult to injury, Comey’s deceptive practices extended beyond his FBI tenure.  Once he was fired by President Trump, he again showed his true colors by leaking confidential information to the media with the expressed intention of triggering a special counsel investigationComey’s pattern of unethical bias, plus his personal ties to Special Counsel Robert Mueller going back many years, seriously tarnish Mueller’s standing.Donald Trump triumphed in 2016 because he promised to “drain the swamp” in Washington.  Sadly, the swamp has proven resilient, from Capitol Hill to James Comey in obstructing the president’s transformational agenda.In the end, the will of the people must prevail and smash a rigged system that has stolen the dignity and prosperity of Americans.Steve Cortes is a Fox News contributor, former Trump campaign operative and spokesman for the Hispanic 100.

The media almost uniformly applied to the speech its favorite (though misused) descriptor: “populist.” But the real news was that Mr. Trump wants to make Reagan-style tax reform great again.The left saw this clearly, which explains its furious and frustrated reaction to the speech. “Trump’s New Tax Scam: Selling Plutocracy as Populism,” ran a headline in Vanity Fair, bemoaning that “Trickle-down is back, baby.” Democratic strategist Robert Shrum railed in a Politico piece that the “plutocrat” Mr. Trump was pitching a tax cut for “corporations and the top 1 percent” yet was getting away with a “perverted populism.” Trump voters had been “tricked into voting against themselves,” and now Mr. Trump was pulling a similar con with taxes. Nonsense. Mr. Trump is selling pro-growth policies—something his party has forgotten how to do. And there’s nothing very “populist” about it, at least not by today’s political standards. The left has defined the tax debate for decades in terms of pure class warfare. Republicans have so often been cast as stooges for the rich that the GOP is scared to make the full-throated case for a freer and fairer tax system. It was precisely the right’s desire for a more “populist” tax policy that gave us the Reformicons and their manifesto for buying off the middle class.To continue reading Kimberley Strassel's column in the Wall Street Journal, click here.Kimberley Strassel writes the Potomac Watch column for the Wall Street Journal where she is a member of the editorial board.

articles[10] = "\n                                     \n                                As the floodwaters slowly recede in Texas, the liberal media continue to relentlessly attack President Trump, despite the tremendous job he is doing to deal with Hurricane Harvey.  The president deserves a great deal of credit for working with congressional leaders to help fund recovery from the killer storm. Late Friday night the White House asked Congress for $7.85 billion to fund the continuing federal response to the hurricane. President Trump has also pledged $1 million of his own money to help victims. Yet media attacks harp on criticism of President Trump for his conduct on his first visit to Texas not long after Harvey hit.     ABC News, a supposedly impartial source of information, ran with the following headline: “Trump thanks Texas officials for hurricane response, barely addresses victims.”CNN’s headline was similarly backhanded: “Trump wins praise in Texas, but keeps empathy at bay.” A Newsweek reporter chose to defend his fellow media members, claiming “reporters are rescuing people in Texas” even “as Trump attacks the media.”  Others shifted to climate change, blaming President Trump’s pro-growth policies for the devastating flood damage. The first line of a New York Daily News story read: “When it rains under President Trump, the protections will be poor.”A Los Angeles Times editorial urged the president to recognize “climate change is a global threat” in light of Hurricane Harvey. As if hurricanes and floods haven’t existed for centuries.  Now that the tragedy in Charlottesville has left the front page, the liberal media can no longer so frequently exploit the despicable actions of white supremacists to smear President Trump. So journalists are using their stories on Hurricane Harvey to propagate their anti-Trump agenda.  Far too little attention is paid to the fact that the president expressed his support for Harvey’s victims, saying his heart “goes out even more so to the great people of Texas.” And even before that, the president mobilized federal resources and provided much-needed leadership under difficult circumstances. He continues to do this.In addition, President Trump and his wife made a second visit to Texas Saturday, landing in Houston.Imagine if President Obama received the same negative media coverage after the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, when he failed to name radical Islam as the cause of the carnage. Not a single mainstream news headline read: “Obama thanks first responders in Orlando, fails to mention radical Islam.”The same goes for the 2015 San Bernardino shooting or the infamous Benghazi attack in 2012. Not once did President Obama forcefully condemn radical Islamic terrorism by name, which never drew fire from the liberal media. In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, ABC News opted for a puffy human interest angle. A 2012 headline read: “Obama meets with parents who lost sons in Sandy.” The liberal media purposely positions President Trump in a lose-lose situation. The same media that attacked President George W. Bush for visiting post-Katrina New Orleans too late blames President Trump for visiting post-Harvey Texas too early.MSNBC whined about “real concern” regarding the president’s trip, suggesting it diverts valuable resources from the rescue effort. No one in the White House is immune. First Lady Melania Trump was widely criticized for wearing high heels as she boarded a helicopter on her way to a flight to Texas. This despite the fact that that she changed into sneakers once the plane touched down.The New York Times devoted several stories to Mrs. Trump’s high heels and alleged naiveté. One snarky headline read: “Melania Trump, off to Texas, finds herself on thin heels.” The attacks became so outrageous that even Trevor Noah, the liberal host of “The Daily Show,” stood up for the first lady. The mainstream media should be ashamed. When the press exploits a natural disaster to score political points, it ultimately does a disservice to the victims who have lost everything in Hurricane Harvey’s floodwaters. Our attention should be focused on them, the first responders, the continued rescue effort and federal aid being provided – not anti-Trump zingers and high heels.  Countless videos have revealed truly awe-inspiring heroism on the streets of Houston and other parts of Texas. Americans of all backgrounds are helping each other stay safe. Ignore the fake news, watch these videos and pray for the people of Texas.Ted Harvey is chairman of the Committee to Defend the President."

The Trump administration has already made significant strides toward getting the economy back on track, especially when it comes to regulatory reform – progress that’s been reflected in the markets.The Trump administration, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in particular under the leadership of Administrator Scott Pruitt, have taken a “smart growth” approach to cutting red tape and rolling back regulations.  Contrary to what many on the left may say, Trump and Pruitt are not anti-regulation as long as regulations aren’t overly costly and burdensome and they don’t hinder or hurt American job growth that is the administration’s top priority.As evidence, Pruitt was right to defend the EPA’s Significant New Alternatives Policy or SNAP program when companies from France and Mexico sued in federal court to have it scrapped. A three-judge panel ruled in a split decision, 2-1, to get rid of this program but there’s a chance the full court could reverse the ruling if Pruitt appeals. This ruling was unfortunate, as it permitted foreign companies to transcend U.S. private sector investment and innovation that led to job growth here at home and the exporting of new technology around the world.  American ingenuity, combined with over a billion dollars of private investment – without a dime coming from the federal treasury – resulted in the development of new, safer environmental technology, only to see a court side with foreign companies.The EPA program that created the landscape for these innovative, new technologies is actually rooted in the conservative environmental stewardship of former President Ronald Reagan and former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Pruitt should stand up for American investment, innovation and our workers by appealing this decision as there’s a chance the full court may side with him and the Trump administration.In urging him to do so, former conservative presidential candidate Steve Forbes noted the ruling hurts U.S. companies and workers who invest and innovate.  As Bloomberg News Intelligence chemicals analyst Christopher Perrella noted, “It’s good for the companies and it’s good for the planet. That’s a win-win regardless of your thoughts on climate change.”Under the EPA’s program new chemical technologies that meet the market demand for certain products were developed with nary a dime from the federal treasury. These new chemicals, known as HFOs, are primarily used for refrigeration in homes, in cars, in mass transit and elsewhere. If the ruling stands, private sector investment of over a billion dollars will have been for naught. The fallout could be even worse as the ruling will likely create a chilling effect (no pun intended) over American industry, as why should companies risk investing in the future only to have a court pull the rug out from under them?Thus the ruling, while initially unfortunate, presents an opportunity for Pruitt and the Trump administration to demonstrate its support for American industry’s ingenuity and innovation – and the workers who provide it – as well as its support for effective environmental stewardship. The economy is beginning to turn in the right direction and the United States is poised to be a leader on multiple fronts – including investment, development of needed technology, and the exporting of these products around the globe – which will only mean more good paying jobs for the American people.Ken Blackwell, a former domestic policy adviser to the Trump/Pence Transition Team, is a former Secretary of State and State Treasurer for the state of Ohio and former mayor of Cincinnati."

And while you claim your name means you’re anti-fascist, you’ve shown by your actions that you’re really anti-American and anti-freedom.You’ve assaulted hundreds of President Trump’s supporters at rallies. You’ve vandalized property in the nation’s capital after the Trump inauguration. And you’ve gone on an arson rampage because you were upset that former Breitbart News Senior Editor Milo Yiannopoulos was supposed to speak at the University of California, Berkeley. In Charlottesville, you arrived on the scene with clubs and shields, prepared to commit violence.  Instead, your sick plans were superseded by the monstrous behavior of neo-Nazis, Ku Klux Klan members and other right-wing extremists as lunatic as you are. But they don’t have much of the liberal media working as agit-prop wings for them every day, like you do.If there’s anything you Antifa members hate it’s free speech, the Bill of Rights and the United States of America. In this, you have a lot in common with the fascists you denounce, as well as communist tyrants.Last Sunday, near your operational headquarters in Berkeley, you proved again that you are a nest of Marxist vipers. You went on yet another violent rampage, attacking innocent conservative men and women who were holding a peaceful rally.That’s your modus operandi: intimidation of anyone you deem your enemy through organized violence. You believe you are always right, those you disagree with you are always wrong, and as a result you are justified in physically attacking them to shut them up.If there’s anything you Antifa members hate it’s free speech, the Bill of Rights and the United States of America. In this, you have a lot in common with the fascists you denounce, as well as communist tyrants.You so-called anti-fascists are really nothing more than communists yourselves, aren’t you? I’m sure it’s no coincidence that your banner resembles the German Communist Party flag from the 1920’s.No doubt you believe that you’re on a roll and that through further assaults and intimidation you’ll be able to change the political climate and remake our nation into Soviet American Union.Nothing could be further from the truth. Here’s what’s going to happen:Your group is going to be destroyed – either by law enforcement, or by average Americans, or by both.At the end of the day, you will be piled on the ash heap of history with a myriad of other thugs, authoritarian movements and tyrants from the past.You’ve had a field day picking on college millennials and unarmed reporters. You’ve cold-cocked Trump supporters with rocks and attacked conservative women with pepper spray. And all the while, local police were forced to look on helplessly, under orders from liberal mayors who support “the resistance.”Newsflash for you: You haven’t actually met the real resistance yet, but with your determination for violence and bloodshed you probably will.The real resistance consists of millions of veterans, patriots and hard-working Americans who are sick and tired of Antifa violence and suppression of free speech. Many of these patriots would rather die than let the Bill of Rights be trampled on and incinerated by domestic terrorists like you. Of course, you could just stop being violent, stop suppressing free speech and go home. Then we could all live peacefully as free men and women in the greatest country on earth.But history has taught us that people like you are not going to stop. Therefore, you’d be wise to heed the words of the Bible and Matthew: ‘Those who live by the sword die by the sword.”You might want to put down your copy of \"Rules for Radicals,\" take off your goggles and masks, and think about that.More and more Americans are on to you. Despite your name, we know you are outlaws who embrace violence and hatred of America in the same way as the communists, the Nazis, Al Qaeda and ISIS.  Ray Starmann is the founder of US Defense Watch.

articles[13] = "\n                                     \n                                On Inauguration Day, leftwing protesters took to the streets of the nation’s Capital. They burned cars, shattered store fronts, blocked off checkpoints leading to the Capitol grounds, pelted police officers with rocks, and harassed law-abiding Americans trying to watch our 45th President take his oath of office.Police in downtown Washington arrested 217 of these so-called Antifa militants during what CNN called “ugly street clashes.” On the same day, police arrested even more violent leftwing protestors in New York, Chicago, Portland, Dallas, and other cities across the nation.The elite media went to great lengths to portray these attacks as isolated incidents. National news outlets emphasized the peaceful demonstrations by other distraught liberals, while conveniently neglecting to mention the many Americans who were peacefully enduring Antifa’s abuse. By the next day, most of the media had abandoned the topic all together, shifting their focus to more “pressing” issues, like comparing the size of the 2017 inauguration crowd with the attendance of previous years.Thus, the Left’s violence was concealed. But this was only the beginning.NPR described the attack as “scattered violence,” claiming it was “unclear how the aggressors were aligned.” Even after citing another journalist who said the violence was caused by members of Antifa, the network made sure to add that “the man being beaten may have been a member of the alt-right.”In February, leftwing protestors at the University of California, Berkeley rioted – causing $100,000 in damage to the campus – and forced the university to cancel a speech by former Breitbart.com editor Milo Yiannopoulos.A month later at Middlebury College, liberals shouted down political scientist and author Charles Murray, preventing him from giving a speech. As if this wasn’t enough to satisfy these rioters, a group of masked militants then proceeded to attack Murray, injuring a faculty member in their fury.In an attempt to rationalize the violent outbursts of leftist groups, the mainstream media characterized the speakers as controversial, provocative right-wingers whose extreme views drove the otherwise normal liberal Americans into frenzy.After the tragic events in Charlottesville, Virginia this month, the media rightly castigated violence carried out by hateful Neo-Nazi groups and Ku Klux Klan members, but they blatantly disregarded the violent acts committed by Antifa militants who were also there.In San Francisco this past Sunday, a small army of masked, armed Antifa members swarmed and attacked a group of conservatives who were peacefully protesting Marxism in America – as well as the police protecting the group. The Berkeley Police ultimately arrested 13 of the Antifa activists, charging some with felony assault, assault with a deadly weapon, and other violations.This was a clear, coordinated offensive on innocent Americans exercising their rights to free speech, protest, and assembly. The victims of this attack were not advocating for hate, racism, or any other malign or violent philosophy. They were opposing communism – a political system which most Americans have opposed for decades.  However, once again, members of the elite media have failed to condemn this violence – and instead have worked tirelessly to mute and downplay terror being committed by fellow liberals.On Monday, NPR described the attack as “scattered violence,” claiming it was “unclear how the aggressors were aligned.” Even after NPR cited another journalist who said the violence was caused by members of the leftwing Antifa group, the network made sure to add that “the man being beaten may have been a member of the alt-right.”Huffington Post writer Andy Campbell described the liberal aggression as “scuffles” in a piece that included the triumphant liberal subhead, “A Rally that Had Been Called Off Got Drowned Out, Anyway.” Campbell implied in his article that both groups engaged in violence and were arrested, which was completely, intentionally false.The Washington Post’s coverage acknowledged that Antifa was responsible, but they unsurprisingly managed to indirectly blame President Donald Trump. They asserted that violence “has become a regular feature” of his presidency and “gives signs of spiraling upward, particularly in the wake of the violence in Charlottesville.”So, the elite national media’s take on the violence in Berkeley on Sunday was: Yes, violent liberals attacked a small group of conservative protestors – but it’s not really their fault.Based on how the mainstream media has covered the Charlottesville tragedy and the protests in Berkeley, it is reasonable to say they believe there is no moral equivalence between violence fueled by bigotry and violence committed by people who hate others for their political ideology.This message is wrong and dangerous to our Republic.Even the few outside news outlets that accurately reported the event in Berkeley as a clear assault by leftwing activists on police and peaceful protestors, still failed to condemn these acts as threats to free speech and peaceable assembly – the foundation of our Constitution’s First Amendment.Prolonged silence about the Left’s violence is dangerous. It’s time for the national media to reflect and start condemning leftwing attacks just as vehemently as it does the brutality of Neo-Nazis, the KKK, and other hateful groups.Violence in all forms is wrong and must be harshly rebuked by all Americans.Newt Gingrich is a Fox News contributor.

articles[14] = "\n                                     \n                                As Harvey made landfall and was wreaking havoc in Texas, there was another sort of destruction unfolding in Berkeley, California, this one of the human variety. On August 27th, hundreds of Antifa, the black-clad violent fascist anarchists, set like locusts upon about 20 peaceful sign-holding Trump supporters in a Berkeley park, threatening, chasing and beating them.Yet something different happened after this typical scene of Antifa-organized violence—a major American newspaper told the truth. The Washington Post’s headline was shocking, not because of the subject matter, but because it actually reflected the facts of the matter on the ground: “Black-clad antifa members attack peaceful right-wing demonstrators in Berkeley.”The end result of the attack was like every other Antifa riot—people were injured, some sent to hospitals, and over a dozen Antifa were arrested.Up until Berkeley, which was not even one of Antifa’s most violent actions, the media had soft-pedaled the group’s violence. Reporters and journalists, inexplicably, generally refused to name them in coverage and worked to cast their violence as self-defense or action against “haters” or of course, the now ubiquitous “fascists.”Other headlines around the country about their brutality continued to obscure the true nature of what Antifa was doing. The San Francisco Chronicle announced, “Berkeley police identify 13 people arrested amid violence at right-wing rally.”The August 28 Washington Post headline and article, which bluntly laid out the truth of the violence by Antifa at Berkeley, sent a message to the liberal political and media world: that the romance was over.The Los Angeles Times: “Protests in Berkeley turn violent as counter-protesters, pro-Trump forces clash.” Really? There was no clashing, unless you consider a father and son Trump supporters running for their lives a “clash.” Antifa didn’t “turn” violent, they came ready to inflict harm.CNN’s coverage of Antifa has been Orwellian and even seemingly sympathetic. With a headline (eventually scrubbed) that actually noted, “Unmasking the Leftist Antifa Movement: Activists Seek Peace Through Violence,” they then compared Antifa’s rhetoric to Founding Father John Adams.Antifa is not new. The media know who they are and what they do. They are an extension of the “Black Bloc” anarchists best known for their violent actions at World Trade Organization and G8 gatherings. They were a part of the now defunct Occupy movement. Their current incarnation is as laughably absurd fascist anti-fascists.Reporters have been the subject of Antifa violence. One was arrested at Charlottesville for punching a female reporter for “The Hill.”On Twitter, various journalists reported being attacked or seeing assaults by Antifa on other reporters. Also at Charlottesville, Katie Couric tweeted that she and her production team were sprayed with urine, a regular assault tactic of Antifa.At a rally in Richmond, Virginia, one day after the Charlottesville horror, a local CBS reporter was hospitalized after being struck in the head with an object. Antifa admitted the assault on social media, which the reporter said began after the thugs ordered him to stop filming, which he refused.Then finally, the Washington Post story, out of the blue, naming and blaming Antifa, while at the same time making it clear the “right wing” victims were peaceful. In part, the media sees the message of anti-Trump Antifa as helpful to their anti-Trump narrative.After all, we’re told, Mr. Trump’s election signals the spread of racism throughout America. How better to facilitate that narrative than to elevate and highlight people who claim the urgent need to attack America’s growing problem with fascism?The August 28 Washington Post headline and article, which bluntly laid out the truth of the violence by Antifa at Berkeley, sent a message to the liberal political and media world: that the romance was over.Some didn't get the message right away. Just a few hours after the Post’s story, the headline in New York Magazine’s \"Daily Intelligencer\" column was “Antifa beats up Trump supporters, Fuels Right-Wingers.” Their spin against Antifa wasn’t that mindless, anarchic violence against innocent people was bad, it was “images of defenseless Trump supporters being mobbed by their ideological nemeses lent stark visual support to the conservative narrative that antifa is a menace equivalent to white nationalism.”Yet 24 hours later, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi issued a statement condemning Antifa which in part read, “The violent actions of people calling themselves antifa in Berkeley this weekend deserve unequivocal condemnation, and the perpetrators should be arrested and prosecuted…”It’s arguable that media’s choice to coddle Antifa came at a time when liberals believed it would help their narrative casting Mr. Trump and his supporters, as racists. That did not work, and in fact is backfiring.The Washington Post sent a message that the party was over. At least now perhaps we can expect more in media to be honest about Antifa and its violent agenda. Tammy Bruce is a radio talk-show host, New York Times best-selling author and Fox News political contributor."
articles[15] = "\n                                     \n                                America is reeling from the onslaught of Hurricane Harvey. In the midst of the suffering from the unparalleled flooding, we have seen remarkable examples of heroism and community coming to the aid of those in peril. Americans have been enduring for weeks media, the political class and their operatives malevolently insisting that all of America is hopelessly racist and its president a facilitator of white supremacists, so watching Texans helping their stricken neighbors has been a good reminder of who we, as Americans, really are. This is a small silver lining of a horrible event, as various malcontents continue to push on with their attempts to cast America as irredeemably irredeemable.Warnings of a “slippery slope” are often heard, especially when extremists demand the removal of statues they deem offensive. There are very sincere people calling for the removal of Confederate statues, but the organized left behind the hysteria are self-styled Marxists, specifically the World Workers Party, and anarchists, like Antifa.Attacks on a variety of cultural symbols is necessary to send a message that America was born of racism, is still racist and must be dismantled.Their concerns are not racism or even being offended; their goal is to condemn the United States and capitalism. For them, the only way to remake society is to rebuild it from ashes.Attacks on a variety of cultural symbols is necessary to send a message that America was born of racism, is still racist and must be dismantled.Cases in point: A CBS New York headline: “New York City ‘Symbols Of Hate’ Purge Could Target Columbus Statue, Grant’s Tomb.” President Grant, you see, is regarded by some as anti-Semitic.ESPN removing a sportscaster named Robert Lee from working a University of Virginia game to avoid imagined backlash, is now infamous. It was also so incomprehensible many, including this columnist, simply didn’t believe it. It was true, and a sign of how perceived public pressure as promulgated by media, and the fear of violence, produces a mass hysteria that facilitates the craven Marxist agenda embraced by so few.We also now have what is known as the “Traveler Mascot Controversy.” You see, the University of Southern California’s mascot’s horse has a name similar to Robert E. Lee’s horse, ergo, Traveler must go. Free Beacon reports, “Saphia Jackson, USC’s Black Student Assembly co-president, accused Traveler IX last week of being a symbol of white supremacy, and said it should be removed from campus.”The good news is someone is standing up to this absurdity: “An acclaimed sports broadcaster [Brent Musberger] said Sunday on Barstool Sports’ podcast ‘Pardon My Take’ that he would not vote for University of Southern California quarterback Sam Darnold to receive the Heisman Trophy if the university were to change its mascot’s name,” The Washington Free Beacon reported.But let’s not stop there. A writer at Salon, a far-left website, has declared, according to The Daily Caller, that “The Star-Spangled Banner” is America’s national anthem because “neo-Confederates elevated” the song “as a way of honoring Southern slaveowners’ rebellion.” The reasoning behind all this, the writer attests, is due to the “popular awakening” reflected in the demand to remove offensive statues.Not everything is as camera-ready as the defacing, beheading and tearing down of statues. After featuring the iconic American film, “Gone with the Wind” for 34 years, a Memphis theater announced it will no longer screen the film once a year at its festival.The New York Times noted the theater was removing it due to its “insensitive” nature and because of a “heated” online discussion. The decision was met with even more discussion, online and in the press.USA Today reported on the social media outrage, “Even a French cultural icon, erudite philosopher and cineaste Bernard-Henri Levy, had something to say in 140 characters, joining right-wing critics in condemning restraint on free expression. ‘Appalled by #Gonewiththewind cancellation at Memphis Orpheum Theater: alarming suppression of artistic expression,’ Mr. Levy declared on Twitter.”Columnist John Nolte perfectly notes on the fecklessness of the censors, “There is no moral difference between a community library bullied into removing a book and a community theater bullied into canceling a screening. Moreover, there is no moral difference between a mob burning a book and a mob bullying a film group into memory-holing a movie.”The good news in all of this bullying by a few hostile Marxists, who can organize online, are the facts of the matter. Mr. Nolte points out that 73 percent of African-Americans “rank ‘Gone With the Wind’ as a good/very good movie? That is only 14 points lower than whites. Our media would never tell you that. Doesn’t fit the narrative.”Moreover, in the wake of Charlottesville, the Federalist reported that a new poll “shows that most Americans, including a plurality of African-Americans, don’t agree with efforts to tear down Confederate statues. According to a new poll conducted by Marist for NPR/PBS News Hour, 62 percent of Americans want the statues to stay where they are.”One message for all of us is to not let volume or intensity of news coverage dictate reality. These issues are complex even without agitation from leftists who have no one’s best interests in mind. Having serious discussions about who we are as Americans has allowed us to become better people. If we acquiesce to a small cadre of leftist bullies and censors, they’ll not only wipe away the past, the future is gone as well.Tammy Bruce is a radio talk-show host, New York Times best-selling author and Fox News political contributor."
articles[16] = "\n                                     \n                                In a scathing August 24 New York Times op-ed, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a Somali-born feminist, author, scholar and former Dutch parliament member, lamented that the far-left Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) “has hit the jackpot” in huge donations in the aftermath of the violence in Charlottesville.  Hirsi Ali noted that Apple pledged $1 million to the SPLC; JP Morgan Chase & Co. half a million; George and Amal Clooney $1 million.While Hirsi Ali condemned Nazism, white supremacy and racial bigotry as having no place in a civilized society, she made it clear that contributing to the SPLC is the wrong way to combat this poison.As I explained in a 2016 Fox News Opinion article, the Southern Poverty Law Center is a left wing smear machine that tries to denigrate conservative individuals and organizations by lumping them together with white nationalists, KKK members and neo-Nazis on so-called hate lists. In a recent Frontpage Magazine article, Daniel Greenfield described the SPLC as “one of the longest running malicious jokes on the internet.”  Conservatives targeted by the SPLC include American Enterprise Institute scholar Charles Murray, Accuracy in Media President Cliff Kinkaid (who SPLC has singled out for challenging global warming), the Family Research Council, and WorldNetDaily founder Joseph Farah.Smearing anyone who speaks out against radical Islam is one of the SPLC’s priorities.  Accordingly, it has placed on its hate lists Jihad Watch and its Director Robert Spencer; American Freedom Defense Initiative and its director Pamela Geller; and Maajid Nawaz a Muslim reformer who runs Quilliam, a London-based organization that aims to counter jihadism and extremism.  My organization, the Center for Security Policy and our president Frank Gaffney, also are on the SPLC’s hate lists due to our principled stand against the Global Jihad Movement.Despite how transparently political the SPLC’s hate lists are, the main stream media regularly cites them as authoritative sources.  Last October, the SPLC added Ayaan Hirsi Ali to its hate list, an appalling act that ignored the decades of intimidation, hatred and fear Ms. Hirsi Ali has endured from radical Islamists.  This decision also reflected the SPLC’s disgraceful practice of turning a blind eye to the violent hatred and extremism of radical Islam, which Hirsi Ali noted in her op-ed includes weekly killing sprees around the world, justifying wife-beating, enslavement of female unbelievers, murdering gay people and virulent anti-Semitism. The violence, hatred and intimidation radical Islamists have inflicted on Ayaan Hirsi Ali have been extreme.  She was subjected to female genital mutilation (FGM) at the age of five when she lived in Somalia.  She fled to the Netherlands to escape an arranged marriage.  After becoming a Dutch citizen, Hirsi Ali was elected to the Dutch Parliament and began working on a film with filmmaker Theo van Gogh titled “Submission” on the oppression of women under Islam.  Van Gogh was assassinated by a radical Islamist for making this film.  After other radical Islamists threatened to kill Hirsi Ali for her work on the film, she was forced to live in a secret location in the Netherlands under high security. Hirsi Ali moved to the United States in 2006 and is now a fellow at Harvard University’s JFK School of Government and a Research Fellow at the Hoover Institution.  She has written two best-selling books, \"Infidel\" (which chronicles her life) and \"Heretic: Why Islam Needs Reformation Now.\"  Because of continuing threats against her life by radical Islamists, Hirsi Ali lives with round-the-clock security and does not travel without an armed security detail.Despite how transparently political the SPLC’s hate lists are, the main stream media regularly cites them as authoritative sources.  CNN recently ran a story about hate groups in the U.S. citing these hate lists which it was forced to partially retract after a backlash by conservatives.  Because of this CNN article and other recent misleading press stories driven by the SPLC, PayPal suspended the accounts of Robert Spencer, Pamela Geller and their organizations.  Fortunately, another backlash forced PayPal to quickly reverse this decision.Targeting conservatives as haters has been very profitable for the SPLC.  It uses its hate lists to generate huge donations, in part through a sophisticated direct mail fundraising operation.  Based on its 2010 tax return, the liberal website Daily Kos criticized the SPLC in 2012 for its enormous wealth, offshore bank account in the Cayman Islands, and ownership in several foreign corporations.Ayaan Hirsi Ali concluded her op-ed by cheering efforts to stand up to neo-Nazi displays like what happened in Charlottesville.   But she urged Apple, JP Morgan and the Hollywood A-list to find more trustworthy and deserving partners to work with other than the odious SPLC to counter this and all other forms of political violence and intolerance. Let’s hope Apple and George Clooney haven't mailed in their checks yet.Fred Fleitz is senior vice president for policy and programs with the Center for Security Policy, a national security think tank.

Antifa and the white nationalists are, in fact, kissing cousins, just as the Nazis and communists were. In fact, communist rhetoric has long called itself anti-fascist. The Berlin Wall was, in East Germany, officially called the Anti-Fascist Protection Barrier.But the white nationalists and Antifa are pretty much the same, working at opposite ends of the political spectrum. One has a swastika. The other has a hammer and sickle. Both are symbols of repressive, murderous regimes.The only significant difference is that members of the media and much of the political left give Antifa the veneer of moral crusade that no one gives the white nationalists. But Antifa does not deserve it. Time and time again, Antifa is violent and thuggish. They claim anyone they attack deserves it, just like the white nationalists claim minorities deserve it. If the left does not do a better job of vocally condemning Antifa, there really well be less people on the right willing to condemn the white nationalists. And both will, as a result, have breathing room to grow when both should be stamped out.On \"Meet the Press\" just two days ago, a Dartmouth professor tried to justify Antifa’s violence. But the violence is not justified and, as we are seeing in Berkeley and elsewhere, the excuse of “punching Nazis” has become justification to punch anyone who is not with Antifa.The truth is that if the left does not do a better job of vocally condemning Antifa, there really well be less people on the right willing to condemn the white nationalists. And both will, as a result, have breathing room to grow when both should be stamped out.Antifa dresses in black. The white nationalists dress in white. They otherwise use the same tactics to advance the same goal — shutting down those who oppose them through any means necessary. Polite society needs to shut them both down and the left needs to drop their claims of moral justification for Antifa’s actions.Erick Erickson is a Fox News contributor.

The most recent average of polls has President Trump at 39 percent approval. One news analyst wrote that Trump is turning us from a 50-50 country to a 60-40 country, with the new majority consolidating against the president. In their eagerness to declare the Trump presidency a failure, the elite media is failing to inform us of two things. Macron is not alone. British Prime Minister Theresa May earned a 34 percent satisfaction rate, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had a July approval rating of 34.2 percent, and the Democratic Party in the United States received 38 percent approval in June.  First, President Reagan had a similar period during his first term when his approval rating fell to 35 percent -- even lower than President Trump’s. Reagan bounced back, carried 49 states in a landslide reelection, and went on to oversee an economic boom and change world history by pushing the Soviet Union into collapse. So, history tells us that presidential approval ratings at this point in time are not indicative of a president’s future success.    Second, in addition to failing to contextualize President Trump’s approval ratings in history, the elite media is ignoring the present. Look, for example, at the radically different way it has treated President Trump and President Emmanuel Macron of France. According to the elite media, Macron is the brilliant young technocrat who saved France from Marine Le Pen and Trump-like populism. Macron won with a stunning 66 percent of the vote. He formed a new party which swept the legislative elections, giving him a unique opportunity to reform France. The news media loved him. They lionized him because he was seen as the anti-Trump. Macron was smooth where Trump was rough. Macron was sophisticated and international where Trump was an American populist (oh how it pains the elite media to have a crude populist as their president when they could have someone elegant who understands fine wine and cheese). Unfortunately for the elite media, the Macron myth has not aged well. As voters came to know him, they were put off by his icy, imperialist aloofness. As they came to understand his proposed reforms, they decided they opposed them. Macron was at 64 percent approval in June. Now, less than two months later, he has fallen to 36 percent....BELOW TRUMP. How can the elite media explain this collapse? How can the elite media rationalize that their young, moderate, sophisticated technocrat is now below President Trump? They can't. So, they don't. However, Macron is not alone. The elite media has also failed to inform viewers that the approval ratings of other world leaders have been recorded at similarly low levels in recent months. For example, British Prime Minister Theresa May earned a 34 percent satisfaction rate, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had a July approval rating of 34.2 percent, and the Democratic Party in the United States received 38 percent approval in June. All of these approval ratings are lower than President Trump’s - but you don’t see the elite media fighting to break that news story. So, the next time you watch biased and uninformed TV pundits opine on President Trump's approval ratings, remember two things: President Reagan’s 49 state reelection victory in 1984 and the current ratings of other world leaders.

articles[19] = "Is America racist? It used to be that racism meant the actual enforcement of bigotry—the routine implementation of racial inequality everywhere in public and private life. Racism was a tyranny and an oppression that dehumanized—animalized—the “other.” It was a social malignancy, yet it carried the authority of natural law, as if God himself had dispassionately ordained it. Today Americans know that active racism is no longer the greatest barrier to black and minority advancement. Since the 1960s other pathologies, even if originally generated by racism, have supplanted it. White racism did not shoot more than 4,000 people last year in Chicago. To the contrary, America for decades now—with much genuine remorse—has been recoiling from the practice of racism and has gained a firm intolerance for what it once indulged. But Americans don’t really trust the truth of this. It sounds too self-exonerating. Talk of “structural” and “systemic” racism conditions people to think of it as inexorable, predestined. So even if bigotry and discrimination have lost much of their menace, Americans nevertheless yearn to know whether or not we are a racist people.

He vowed to end it on Day One of his administration. But thus far, he has kept the program in place -- even though federal courts have found DACA to be an illegal overreach of executive authority, and the Trump Administration already ended a companion program that granted reprieves and work permits to parents of DACA recipients. The Constitution gives Congress -- not the president -- the authority to determine who may legally enter and reside in the United States. It's time for President Trump to fulfill his vow. DACA is flagrantly unconstitutional. And it hurts vulnerable American workers.  The Constitution gives Congress -- not the president -- the authority to determine who may legally enter and reside in the United States. One year before enacting DACA, President Obama himself explained \"With respect to the notion that I can just suspend deportations through executive order, that's just not the case, because there are laws on the books that Congress has passed.\"  But President Obama and his lawyers found what they thought was a clever way around this constitutional barrier. DACA, they said, doesn't give permanent legal residency to illegal aliens.  It merely makes them a very, very low priority for deportation. Such a low priority, in fact, that all 750,000 illegal aliens who signed up for the program would receive an official card instructing Immigration and Customs Enforcement not to deport them unless they committed multiple criminal offenses. It's highly questionable whether the executive branch has this much leeway to selectively enforce Congress' immigration laws. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Andrew Hanen, who issued an injunction freezing an expansion of the DACA program in 2015, explained that, \"DHS cannot reasonably claim that, under a general delegation to establish enforcement policies, it can establish a blanket policy of non-enforcement that also awards legal presence and benefits to otherwise removable aliens.\"  Even supporters of amnesty for illegal aliens agree DACA is unconstitutional. In December, Senator Lindsay Graham tweeted, \"In my view, the DACA Executive Order issued by President Obama was unconstitutional and President-elect Trump would be right to repeal it.\"  For reference, Sen. Graham has sponsored the DREAM Act, a bill that would give U.S. citizenship to illegal aliens who came here as children.  Even if the executive branch did have authority to exempt an entire class of people from deportation, DACA would still be unconstitutional. That's because the president doesn't have the authority to hand out work permits to illegal aliens. As Judge Hanen noted, \"Exercising prosecutorial discretion...does not also entail bestowing benefits.\"  Legal arguments aside, the DACA program hurts American workers. An alarming number of American workers without college degrees are struggling to find work. In the first quarter of 2017, nearly four in ten native-born 18 to 29-year olds without college degrees were either unemployed or not in the labor force.   Illegal immigration exacerbates these young Americans' struggles by increasing the number of people competing for a limited supply of lower-skilled and entry-level jobs. Over the past 20 years, illegal aliens without high school degrees have inflated the low-skill U.S. workforce by approximately 22 percent.     The excess of low-skilled workers means companies don't need to raise wages to fill positions. Native-born workers without a high school degree would earn nearly $800 more annually if there were no illegal immigration.  The burdens of illegal immigration disproportionately fall on American minorities. Harvard Kennedy School economics professor George Borjas' explains that \"Because a disproportionate percentage of immigrants have few skills, it is low-skilled American workers, including many blacks and Hispanics, who have suffered most from this wage dip.\"  Put simply, our most economically vulnerable citizens have the most to lose if President Trump preserves the DACA program.  President Trump repeatedly vowed to end DACA to protect American workers and the rule of law. It's time for him to follow through on this promise.   Bruce C.

articles[21] = " \n                                   Imran Awan was arrested at Dulles International Airport July 24, while attempting to board a flight to Pakistan. For more than a decade the congressional staffer had worked under top House Democrats, and he had just been accused by the FBI of bank fraud. It was a dramatic moment in a saga that started in February, when Capitol Police confirmed an investigation into Mr. Awan and his family on separate accusations of government theft. The details are tantalizing: The family all worked for top Democrats, were paid huge sums, and had access to sensitive congressional data, even while having ties to Pakistan. Even if this never adds up to a spy thriller, it outranks most of the media’s other obsessions.  The media largely has ignored the affair, the ho-hum coverage summed up by a New York Times piece suggesting it may be nothing more than an “overblown Washington story, typical of midsummer.” But even without evidence of espionage or blackmail, this ought to be an enormous scandal. Because based on what we already know, the Awan story is—at the very least—a tale of massive government incompetence that seemingly allowed a family of accused swindlers to bilk federal taxpayers out of millions and even put national secrets at risk. In a more accountable world, House Democrats would be forced to step down. To continue reading Kimberley Strassel's column in the Wall Street Journal, click here.

articles[23] = " \n                                     \n                                 The front page of The New York Times still includes the motto: “All the News That’s Fit to Print.” Some days it’s even accurate. But that wasn’t the case on Tuesday. The Times ran an epic disaster of a news story, claiming that “scientists say they fear the Trump administration could change or suppress” a draft report on climate change produced by scientists from 13 federal agencies that “directly contradicts claims by President Trump and members of his cabinet who say that the human contribution to climate change is uncertain.” The article was in the top spot of the front page, in the upper-right-hand corner with three sets of headlines, stacked on top of one another. You could almost imagine Times staffers high-fiving as they wrote each word – another Resistance victory! My favorite phrase was “fears of suppression.” That referenced the paranoia of anti-Trump forces in the administration. “One government scientist who worked on the report, and who spoke to The Times on the condition of anonymity, said he and others were concerned that it would be suppressed,” wrote climate change stenographer Lisa Friedman. The whole premise of the story was that this report was leaked to The Times out of fear that evil President Trump would hide it. Except the report has been available online since January. The basic premise of the entire story of “suppression” was laughably wrong. Seven months worth of wrong. The paper added a lame correction the next day with a deer-in-the-headlights surprise that it had somehow been inaccurate. Washington Post media writer Erik Wemple gutted The Times for the “screw-up” and its gross incompetence: “That correction, which sits at the foot of the story, dutifully straightens out the record. Yet given the magnitude of the screw-up, it should sit atop the story, surrounded by red flashing lights and perhaps an audio track to instruct readers: Warning: This story once peddled a faulty and damaging premise,” he wrote. Imagine if a conservative outlet had published something this horrendously wrong. The journalism community would scream “Fake news!” and claim that outlet was irresponsible. But when it’s one of news organizations journalists love, all will soon be forgiven. Until the next time. Which takes us to the rest of what was horrible this week: 2. Google Doesn’t Believe In Freedom: Google the phrase, “Google doesn't believe in freedom,” and you should see stories about its former employee James Damore. Damore is one of those windmill tilters who would have made Don Quixote proud. Damore worked for Google as an engineer. Until this week. Damore made the mistake of writing up a big memo about the flaws in Google’s diversity initiatives, but stressed he was pro-diversity. “I strongly believe in gender and racial diversity, and I think we should strive for more. However, to achieve a more equal gender and race representation, Google has created several discriminatory practices,” he wrote. Liberals were triggered and Google fired Damore, creating a firestorm as Social Justice Warriors gathered Twitter mobs to destroy Damore. Journalists repeatedly misrepresented what he wrote, eager to crush people who challenged someone “Game of Thrones” fans might call the Great Sept of Diversity. One New York Times writer called what Damore wrote the “sexist/racist writings like the Google memo.” No bias there, never! CNN misrepresented the memo and called it an “anti-diversity manifesto.” That’s the tag team of irresponsibility – claiming it’s anti-diversity when Damore said he’s not and then titling it a “manifesto,” just like the Unabomber. The “anti-diversity” phrasing was common – from CNBC to Fortune and even Reuters. Journalists love diversity. Until you tell them, as Damore did, it should include diversity of opinions. Conservatives who are used to mistrusting major media outlets should add Google to that list of businesses that embrace the liberal agenda as doctrine. Before we’re all marched down some internet street as the mob shouts, “Shame!” 3. CNN Purges Pro-Trump Jeffrey Lord: Firing people for their politics is all the rage. CNN dropped pro-Trump commentator Jeffrey Lord after Lord had a testy exchange with a lefty activist on Twitter, ending the exchange by mockingly tweeting, “Sieg Heil!” Lord (who writes occasionally for Newsbusters, where I work) pointed out that there’s an obvious left-wing campaign against Fox News. After a testy exchange, he posted a link to a column calling that campaign “fascist.” Lord’s piece stressed: “This is America … Not Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany or Communist Russia.” Unfortunately, lefty activists keep trying to reset the GPS. 4. Media’s Explosive North Korea Rhetoric: The news media’s anti-Trump default has put them in strange company this week – sympathizing with nuclear-armed North Korean nut job Kim Jong Un. Kim is the latest canker on the North Korean body politic, leading a nation of roughly 25 million that is a mix of bizarre death cult and medieval concentration camp. Hardly the guy sane people seek as an ally. But Trump’s strong words against Kim have caused the media to stand up … to Trump. Repeatedly. CBS turned to former Clinton aide Jake Sullivan to bash Trump and then let him get away with it. “It just doesn't help when our allies and the countries in the region can’t tell whether it's Donald Trump or Kim Jong Un who's the crazier one,” said Sullivan. CBS staff? Crickets. MSNBC called Trump’s response to North Korea’s continued threats of nuclear attack, “a far more stark, a far more inflammatory, a far more dangerous red line.” The networks reliably turned to Republicans who would speak out against Trump, and polls that undercut him amidst a dangerous crisis. 5. Guess What’s Left Out Of All The Gore Coverage?: With all the coverage of former Vice President Al Gore, it’s almost like he has his own TV network. Oops, he tried that once, before selling it to the oil nation of Qatar while telling all of us that oil money is dirty. But there’s one story getting little attention at all. Gore bought carbon offsets for his first film 11 years ago, some of which have gone toward … absolutely nothing. All of the carbon from “An Inconvenient Truth” was “offset” for the Owl Feather War Bonnet Wind Farm on the Rosebud Sioux Reservation in South Dakota. Those offsets cost all of $1,000 out of Al’s mighty war chest. Eleven years later, Gore is still using the same carbon offset company and the wind farm still isn’t built. Rather than focus on how silly carbon offsets are, the media just continue to talk Gore. They tried and failed to help his sequel break into the top 10 movies. But Gore-adoring journos are unlikely to start poking into things that embarrass him – like talking about how he flies more than many jet pilots and tells us all that fossil fuels are bad. How come journalists won’t ask the guy involved in creating the internet why he never heard of Skype or telecommuting? 6. Hollywood Hates Conservatives This Much: It’s not even fall TV season. All we have now is the summer filler schedule and it’s filled alright – with vicious attacks on people the networks consider evil – conservatives or Republicans. It’s like conservatives are the ordinary soldiers lined up to fight Daenerys Targaryen, waiting to be barbecued by her pet dragon. Go get a group together and ask them, if you have a dustpan and brush. Here are just a few highlights from one week of summer TV. Again, this is just one week. Hulu’s “Difficult People” called Vice President Mike Pence a “failed prototype for one of those Japanese sex robots” and presented the new seal of his office as a swastika. That pales by comparison to Netflix’s “Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,” which depicted both President Ronald Reagan and VP George H.W. Bush defecating graphically on an architectural model Reagan didn’t like. (Doubt me? Here’s video.) A character in FX’s “Snowfall” even casually threw darts at a large picture of President Ronald Reagan. Think Hollywood hates Republicans? Just a little bit? There’s lots more, of course, that’s not all political. “Every couple should have a threesome,” proclaimed one character after a third-anniversary three-way tryst (“The Carmichael Show” – NBC); a priest having an affair with a married woman (“People of Earth” – TBS); and complaints that Indianapolis Colts bosses donate to \"right-wing f**ks,\"  (Ballers –HBO). Actor/activist James Cromwell told The Daily Mail that Hollywood needs to become more activist. “This community’s got to get more political,” he argued. One wonders how that would even be possible.

articles[24] = " \n                                     \n                                 House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), is perhaps the most powerful representative the Democrats have. When she speaks, it means something. And what she’s been speaking about lately is that others shouldn’t be speaking at all. That’s frightening. One might expect extremists in her party to have trouble with the First Amendment, but it’s alarming that the top Democrat in the House jumps on the bandwagon. Is this how most Democrats feel? The National Park Service recently announced that a right-wing rally by the group Patriot Prayer can go forward Saturday at federally owned Crissy Field in San Francisco, near the Golden Gate Bridge. Pelosi calls members of the group white supremacists (though they say they support peace, love and unity). While the group is controversial, the right of its members to speak shouldn’t be. But it sure is to Pelosi, whose grip on the First Amendment appears a bit shaky. This is from her statement on the National Park Service decision: “In San Francisco, we have great reverence for the Constitutional right to dissent and peaceful free speech,” Pelosi said. “However, free speech does not grant the right to yell fire in a crowded theater, incite violence or endanger the public in any venue. As we ponder where and by whom the ill-conceived decision to approve this permit in a national park was made, we must all pray it does not become an invitation to incite violence.” Pelosi reveres the “right to dissent and peaceful free speech?” Then the rally shouldn’t trouble her. Patriot Prayer wants to present a different viewpoint, and the permit allows members to hold a peaceful rally to express their beliefs, not to loot and pillage. Then Pelosi pulls out the old chestnut about yelling fire in a crowded theatre. She’s paraphrasing U.S. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes’ famous line about “falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic.” Holmes actually described a very limited exception to the First Amendment, but that doesn’t stop every would-be censor from pulling it out. In fact, so many have misused the Holmes statement, and so often, that I’m guessing if he were around today he’d regret he ever wrote it. Perhaps the most troubling part of Pelosi’s response is that she worries the rally will become an “invitation to incite violence.” What does that mean? If members of Patriot Prayer commit violence, they should be held responsible and prosecuted. But if groups opposing Patriot Prayer – and a number have promised to show up – don’t like what they hear and attack the rally, then they are responsible for their own violence. Pelosi shouldn’t be afraid to say that, but based on her phrasing, it almost sounds like the opposition could claim “it’s not our fault, they incited us.” Discussing this issue on TV recently, Pelosi said “the Constitution does not say that a person can yell wolf in a crowded theatre.” I can forgive her for the gaffe. In fact, she may be right – falsely yelling “wolf!” in a crowded theatre might cause a panic as much as shouting “fire!” What I can’t forgive her for is the sentiment behind it. It makes her a wolf in sheep’s clothing, claiming to protect the safety of the public, when all she’ll do is rip up the Constitution.

Big, bad Donald Trump got so close to her during the presidential debate last fall, she says, that he “made her skin crawl.” “Morning Joe” broadcast a recording of Mrs. Clinton reading that revealing snippet aloud yesterday, her plain, hard intonations trying to excite interest in “What Happened?” her new book purporting to explain why she lost the election. The passage, which recounts her musing about how she should react to his looming presence, evokes several responses. Number one: if that’s the best tease they could find in this unnecessary oeuvre (don’t we all know why she lost?), I hope Simon & Schuster has a sure-fire way to get their advance back. The company is deep in the hole after publishing her last tome, “Hard Choices,” which sold only some 280,000 copies in its first year. For that one they reportedly ponied up an advance of $14 million; whatever they paid for this one, it was probably too much. By the way, that sales total for “Hard Choices,” a stunningly dull work, doesn’t come close to the million-plus copies sold of Trump’s “Art of the Deal;” one more round to Trump.  Number two: her recollection may be faulty. Hillary’s memory often plays tricks on her, like when she mistakenly remembered having come under sniper fire in Bosnia, or when she blamed the Benghazi attack on a video, or when she said that all her grandparents had immigrated to the U.S. (Three of four were born in this country.) The morning after the debate in question, then-candidate Trump, accused of having tried to intimidate her, denied the charge, and claimed that it was Clinton who invaded his space. The video shown on Morning Joe shows Trump standing at some distance from Hillary, not breathing down her neck, contrary to her description of the scene. He patiently waits at his lectern while she speaks. What is the truth? Number three: in the book, she says that at the time, feeling uncomfortable, she wished she could “hit pause, and say to everyone watching, well, what would you do?” That is so extraordinarily revealing. Hillary Clinton, at that moment, feeling pressured by her rival and uncertain how to respond, actually wants to take a survey. She doesn’t trust her own instincts, so turns to crowd-sourcing for answers. Maybe this book is more telling than we had imagined because, indeed, that is exactly one of the reasons Clinton lost. Remember early in the campaign when the New York Times wrote an admiring story about Hillary’s intense preparation? How she had consulted no less than 47 experts in preparing her economic agenda? I thought at the time: anyone nearing 70 and readying to run for president must surely know what she believes. But no, she was lost, and still exploring every point of view. The result was a platform-by-committee, a mishmash of policies directed by pollsters and political apparatchiks. You may not agree with Donald Trump’s views or agenda, but by gosh you know what he stood for. Trump promised to Make America Great Again by bringing back jobs, enforcing the rule of law, protecting our borders, demanding fair trade and turning back the Obama-era regulatory blitz. He vowed to put America First. Hillary’s campaign themes were buried under a mudslide of political talking points. One of John Podesta’s leaked emails revealed that Clinton's campaign weighed and ultimately rejected 84 potential slogans before choosing \"Stronger Together,\" a catchphrase that never gained traction. 84! Doesn’t that say it all? Number four: if Hillary is so easily intimidated by powerful men, she really does not belong in the Oval Office. She says in her book that in motoring through that “incredibly difficult moment” she was “aided by a lifetime of dealing with difficult men trying to throw me off.” One wonders, has she always struggled to assert herself with men? Was husband Bill one of those “difficult men?” Maybe her infamous “reset” with Vladimir Putin would have been more successful except that she was cowed by yet another “difficult” man displaying an excess of testosterone. Maybe Hillary is insecure around men because they are bigger than she is. In the video of the debate, Trump appears to be standing virtually on top of Mrs. Clinton, because he is taller. When the camera backs away, it is clear that there are several feet separating the two figures. President Trump stands 6’2”; that kind of height can be imposing or even intimidating to someone several inches shorter. Mrs. Clinton may be one of those people. In the 2008 campaign, her office told reporters that she was 5’5”. In the recent campaign, according to a piece in the Washington Post, her staff claimed she stood 5’7”. That’s remarkable, since she is of an age where she almost certainly is losing height, and not gaining it. Why would someone lie about their height? Does pretending to be taller give her extra confidence? For the record, Maggie Thatcher was 5’5”, as is Angela Merkel. Neither seems to have been intimidated by big, powerful men, including, in the case of Merkel, Donald Trump. Could it be that Hillary simply doesn’t have what it takes to be president? That’s what voters decided. Maybe, at the end, that’s What Happened.  Liz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNews.com.

The leftwing reporters, editors, producers, television personalities, and analysts all find it exciting to watch Republicans try to damage each other. If a moderate Republican attacks a traditional, more conservative Republican, the former is often lionized as a heroic figure for putting citizenship above partisanship. Conservatives attacking other Republicans may not be applauded like moderates, but they are guaranteed to receive maximum coverage for their party cannibalism. So if you are a relatively unknown Republican, with a small online following, you can easily increase your name recognition by simply instigating attacks on other Republicans. Conservatives attacking other Republicans may not be applauded like moderates, but they are guaranteed to receive maximum coverage for their party cannibalism.  While the Republicans who call themselves “Never Trumpers” have gained the most attention for their intraparty attacks, there is also an equal – if not larger – group of “Never Ryan” and “Never McConnell” Republicans. All of this behavior is crazy. When there is a limited amount of time and energy, the rational strategy is to use it to attack your opponents. The real opponents of conservative goals are liberal Democrats. Yet the current conservative anger (including the president's anger) is targeted at Republicans, rather than Democrats. Take, for example, the anger over the Senate’s failure to repeal ObamaCare. Three Republicans and 48 Democrats voted no. That’s 16 Democratic “no” votes for every Republican “no.” Yet when the bill ultimately failed by one vote, it was not the dozens of Democrats who were held up as the problem, it was the three Republicans. It is very unlikely that attacking these three Republicans will cause them to change their minds. None of the three Senators in question are vulnerable to pressure. On the other hand, there are TEN Democratic Senators up for reelection in states President Trump carried in 2016. Every one of these ten Senators is vulnerable to an all-out campaign to explain to their constituents how much they are part of the swamp and how obstructionist and negative they have been. The tax cut bill and the infrastructure bill will offer new powerful opportunities to organize the grassroots to bring pressure to bear on these Democratic Senators. Voting no against President Trump’s agenda can be turned into voting no against the pocketbooks of their own constituents. Similarly, despite all the frustration expressed about Speaker Ryan and Senate Leader McConnell, they are not the enemies of the president's agenda. They may, at times, fall short of the desired legislative majority, but they are working their hearts out to try to get tax cuts, health reform, and other conservative legislation. The two leaders doing everything they can to stop President Trump's agenda are Minority Leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. In Schumer's case, his opposition has included a historic level of obstruction, delay, and stonewalling of President Trump's appointees. It is scandalous how many key positions in the executive branch remain vacant (many of which are currently being occupied by Obama holdovers). This is part of a deliberate strategy of \"resistance\" by Schumer and the Democrats – which, of course, means they are resisting the will of the American people as expressed in the election. Yet because Republicans and conservative activists have been so busy complaining about other Republicans, the Democrats have paid virtually no price for crippling the American government with their obstructionist tactics. If conservative activists and Republicans would focus their attacks on Democrats, then 2018 could become a very good year. With the right grassroots campaign starting this fall, the ten Trump state Democrats would be forced to choose between giving Republicans the votes needed to pass the Trump agenda or being repudiated back home. Either way, the Trump agenda gets passed, either before next November or in 2019, after the vulnerable Democrats lose their elections. So remember, whenever you hear a conservative activist or a Republican complain about a Republican, ask them how much time they have spent that day complaining about the Democrats who are the real opponents of their program and their values.

articles[27] = " \n                                     \n                                 “Why?” “What was the point?” “How is our country better?” “Why did my friends have to die?” “Was it all for nothing?” Those were the questions asked of me by a Special Forces Sergeant in my living room several years ago as he broke down in tears. He had just come back from his fourth combat deployment.  Upon his return, he learned that his wife was leaving him.  As he was discussing that sad development, he suddenly screamed at the top of his lungs: “My three year-old daughter won’t give me a hug.  She doesn’t know me. She thinks I’m a stranger.” Quagmire is too tame a word to describe the life and money-swallowing swamp that is Afghanistan. He had sought me out simply to vent.  He needed to talk to someone and was too fearful of getting professional or military counseling as he was worried it would negatively affect his career. A career, he stressed, which was all that he had left after losing his family to “needless and political deployments.” As President Trump committed our nation to an open-ended timetable in Afghanistan, I thought continuously about that heroic soldier and both the personal sacrifices he made as well as the ultimate sacrifices made by his comrades. Were they for nothing?  Were they in vain?  Is Afghanistan a bottomless abyss of corruption, loss and hopelessness? Both in writing and in conversation, I have made no secret of my overall admiration for President Trump.  I became a fan of his thirty years ago when I worked in the Reagan White House and truly do believe he is the breath of fresh air needed to rid Washington, D.C. of the stench of cronyism and depravity which oozes through the hallways of power. That said, as one who has long believed that the United States has been played for a sucker by other nations into becoming the police force of the world – to the tune of trillions of American tax dollars wasted and the priceless loss of thousands of American service members – I was thrilled to hear then-candidate Trump intimate that we would be getting out of Afghanistan and redirecting those financial resources back into the “crumbling infrastructure” of our own nation. The president’s admitted reversal of his own thinking certainly gave me pause. During his nationally televised speech recommitting our nation to combat in Afghanistan, President Trump made a crucial and much needed point: that as “President Trump” you see the world and its problems in a much different and harsher light than when you were “Candidate Trump.” Now as Commander-in-Chief, President Trump is privy to daily top secret intelligence and military briefings.  Briefings neither he nor any other candidate were allowed to see while on the campaign trail. More than that, he now has three generals advising him daily with regard to his options in Afghanistan and elsewhere in an increasingly worrisome and unpredictable world.   Those three generals are his Chief of Staff John Kelly, his national security advisor H. R. McMaster, and Secretary of Defense James Mattis. Three generals who advised the president to recommit to Afghanistan. Men, who like the president, have access to top secret intelligence briefings and assessments which the rest of us will never see. I acknowledge the value in such access and do believe that “Heavy is the head that wears the crown.” That said, President Trump and his generals could still be wrong.  For a combined 26 years, the former Soviet Union and our nation have not been able to crack the code for victory.  What is really different now? Quagmire is too tame a word to describe the life and money-swallowing swamp that is Afghanistan. While I still oppose the United States remaining in Afghanistan, I do believe President Trump deserves the benefit of the doubt.  He and his military advisors stressed they have finally come up with a winning strategy, and it will soon be obvious if that is the case. As this latest campaign begins, I will remember the Special Forces Sergeant who broke down in my living room. He, his colleagues, and the families who lost a loved one in Afghanistan deserve closure. Our nation owes them all a debt which may never be repaid, but at least closure is a down payment.

articles[28] = " \n                                     \n                                 Despite record job growth, the Dow over 22,000, illegal immigration down 70 percent and massive deregulation, the mainstream media still reports that Donald Trump’s presidency is a failure. To put the final nail in the coffin of the opposition (Republicans, Democrats and the failing mainstream media) President Trump needs victories in three areas: legislative, the court of public opinion, and national defense and diplomacy. First, legislative – more specifically, health care. A handful of Republicans – after campaigning, raising money on and promising the repeal of ObamaCare – failed to deliver. This is why “we the people” like the president more than Congress. But it is not too late for Trump to post a victory here. He can propose a bill to repeal only the individual mandate and he needs to do it louder than anything else he has done to date. That is the single most unpopular element of the health care law and might even garner support from across the aisle – even Democrats have admitted it needs changes. This would be very hard to vote against and the president would post his first legislative victory. And for those Republicans who vote against this? Find and support primary opponents against them in their districts, and campaign hard for them. Send the message. Get on board the Trump Train or get run over. Also in the legislative column: tax reform. What legislator would not want to go home to constituents and be able to say “we put more money in your paycheck?” Here is how you roll it out: send Sarah Huckabee Sanders to the podium with an average middle class American making $50-60,000 a year, hold up his current paycheck, what he makes and what he takes home. Then you hold up a second paycheck with the same salary under Trump’s tax plan highlighting the difference in the take home pay. “This is what President Trump stands for. Congress, the bill is on your desk, make it happen.” She walks out without taking any questions and does not hold a press conference until Congress votes on it. This will allow the White House to go on the offense. It is now Congress’ fault that the White House is not taking questions and the media will naturally turn its sights to the Republicans in Congress for not helping the middle class American, forcing their hand. During this time, Trump, like he did against Hillary and her days since her last press conference, counts the days on Twitter. Boom, second legislative victory in his first year. In the court of public opinion, Trump has been convicted by the mainstream media of Russian collusion. The problem, though, is they have yet to produce any evidence for any of their criminal allegations. Here’s the play: Trump challenges his largest critics on this. Calling out Schumer, Pelosi, Waters and a few more saying that he will participate in the investigation to the fullest for 90 more days on the condition that if nothing is found, they resign their seats. Look, there is no precedent or legal grounds for this. If they don’t respond in 10 days, he fires Special Counsel Robert Mueller. It’s simply a PR play, they will NOT agree to this which gives Trump the opportunity to go on the offense and say, “The Democrats don’t even believe in this investigation.” Finally, national defense. Even with the 15-0 global decision against it at the UN Security Council, North Korea is going to continue to push the envelope until we do something. Sanctions will not work and will only further enrage the regime. North Korea is so poor that people are eating the frogs and bugs in the streets – any sanctions placed on them simply re-directs any limited funds away from his people and back to his military complex. We have a military machine unlike anyone else. Time to use it! Park three carrier groups off the coast. When North Korea launches another missile, we will assume – due to recent threats – that it is not a test and will shoot it down. When they fire another one we shoot that down and destroy the installation that it came from. Then shoot the next one down and destroy three more military establishments. During this time, the president needs to use his PR machine at the White House to continue to encourage Kim Jung Un to come to the table. Put the ball in his court, get him to the table. President Trump is a different type of politician. He made his mark by doing things aggressively and thinking outside the box. I encourage him to stay the course. Mr. President, do what you do best, run over your opponents and don’t look back. As Eric Trump said recently, “The Left would rather see our country fail than Trump succeed.” That is the nature of the opposition. With newly assigned General Kelly at the helm, I have no doubt that this administration is being steered back to the right course.

articles[29] = " \n                                     \n                                 First they said he would never run for president.  Then they said he would never be the Republican nominee for president.  Then they said he could never be elected president.  The latest false narrative being pushed by the liberal media is that some Republicans are making moves to run against President Trump in 2020.  These fake news stories are in the interests of the liberal agenda because they raise manufactured questions about the president’s standing with Republican primary voters and are meant to cause division among conservatives.  Try as they might, the American people are too smart for the elitist gamesmanship going on in the boardrooms at the New York Times and Washington Post.  Here’s the unfortunate reality for liberal Democrats and other so-called “Never Trumpers:”  President Trump is in great shape with grassroots conservatives (regardless of party affiliation) across the country and with good reason.  He’s making good on his promises.   On pro-life issues, the National Right to Life Committee gave President Trump an \"A\" grade for his performance through his first 100 days in office.  On 2nd Amendment rights, President Trump is the first president to address the National Rifle Association leadership forum in 34 years and their Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre said that he sees “a tremendous pride wave out there in the heartland of the country with this president.”  Social conservative leaders praised President Trump’s recent decision to not allow transgender people to serve in the military.  And if all this isn’t enough to satisfy conservatives, Justice Neil Gorsuch’s stellar service on the Supreme Court is icing on the cake.  One thing is clear:  President Trump is an outsider and a change agent and conservatives are elated that he wakes up in the morning to fight the failed status quo in Washington and the biased mainstream news media that only does the bidding of out-of-touch liberals in New York and San Francisco.  There’s much more that conservatives like about the job President Trump is doing.  When it comes to sanctuary city reform and border security, President Trump’s leadership has exceeded all expectations.  In fact, President Trump has been so effective in dealing with sanctuary city lawlessness that elitist liberal Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is suing the Trump Administration to try and keep Chicago a dangerous sanctuary city.    I could go on and on, but one thing is clear:  President Trump is an outsider and a change agent and conservatives are elated that President Trump wakes up in the morning to fight the failed status quo in Washington and the biased mainstream news media that only does the bidding of out-of-touch liberals in New York and San Francisco.  No one knows this better than Vice President Mike Pence.  Since becoming President Trump’s running mate a little over a year ago, Vice President Pence has been a full partner with the president in their mission to enact their conservative reform agenda and “Make America Great Again.”  The vice president is focused like a laser beam on fixing health care, tax reform, and various other initiatives and is doing a great job.  When Vice President Pence travels to Iowa or Ohio to advocate for the president’s agenda it means exactly that and nothing more.  President Trump and Vice President Pence are looking forward to defeating Congresswoman Maxine Waters or whatever leftist the out-of-control Democrat Party nominates in 2020. Also mentioned in some of these disingenuous “news” stories has been career politician John Kasich.  Ohio Governor Kasich ran for president in 2000 and 2016.  In 2000, he didn’t make it to the primaries and in 2016 he won only his home state of Ohio.  President Trump carried Ohio and other Rust Belt states during the general election because his outsider message connected with millions of voters in a way Kasich could not, largely because he was a longtime Washington politician.    President Trump has been in office for only 200 days and yet the mainstream media is already trying to start the 2020 campaign for president.  Are there really Americans out there itching to start watching coverage of the 2020 race even before the 2018 midterms take place? Or is it just because contentious presidential elections are the only thing that sells failing newspapers anymore?  I submit that most reasonable hardworking American taxpayers want to give their president a chance to succeed because if his agenda is enacted, people’s lives will improve.   David N.

The debate over the role of transgendered individuals (people who identify as one gender but have the anatomy of another), has risen again in recent weeks, with President Trump's declaration that transgendered individuals will no longer be able to serve in the military. It will no doubt continue to be a hot debate as the culture wars rage on. The issue of gender dysphoria is real and painful and we must have love and compassion for them.  But I fear they are being politically and monetarily used as the Left, always looking for a new group to exploit, opens new fronts in the culture wars.  Feminists should wonder, however, that if we reconstruct male and female to sixty-three and growing definitions, who is protected and who is hurt? Does this new idea of no binary definition of gender displace and demean the hard fought and won accomplishments of women?   Consider the issue of women's sports. When men are allowed to compete as women, women lose no matter how hard they work. I think yes. Consider the issue of women's sports. When men are allowed to compete as women, women lose no matter how hard they work. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 was crafted to ensure that female athletes were not left out of sports and created a level playing field which encouraged excellence in competition. Congress and feminists understood that boys and girls are physiologically different and that boys vs. boys and girls v. girls was fair because of basic biological and hormonal differences. Title IX has nothing to do with character, power, or intelligence. Fast forward to 2016, when a boy identifying as a girl qualified for the Alaska State Championships in the 200-meter dash, displacing a female athlete for third place. The senior competed against girls as young as freshmen. Hardly fair. In June of this year, a boy identifying as a girl was allowed to compete on the female high school track team in Connecticut and was lauded for placing first in two races. His time would have placed him last in the same races in the boys division. Colleges offer sports scholarships for both genders based on high school accomplishments. But now, these scholarships have the potential to be monopolized by boys in both male and female categories. Last month, it was announced that for the first time since all combat roles were opened to women in December of 2015, there are two female candidates in the Navy SEAL and Special Warfare Combatant-Craft Crewman program (SWCC) programs. This watershed moment for women in the military has the merit to stand alone, but instead, the news story went on to undercut the success of these two women by saying that, in fact, the first woman to join an elite Navy force could be a transgender woman who came out in 2016. Sports titles have been stripped from women, and military achievements by women are being given to men, but surely women can maintain their right to privacy and their respect as child-bearers, right? Wrong. The women’s bathroom is no longer a secure place for women and children to go for privacy. Security is not so narrow as to imply only physical safety, it also encompasses emotional safety. The women’s bathroom is a place where women are vulnerable. To have a man present, no matter his self-perception, compromises that vulnerability. Talk about a need for safe spaces. As if this is not enough, the Huffington Post highlighted a transgender individual holding a sign that read, “Periods are not just for women” while flaunting blood-stained pants between spread legs. If not so horrifying and disrespectful, it would be comical. Of course, periods are just for women and most of us have more dignity than to flaunt them for a political stunt. By using a woman’s menstrual cycle, which indicates her unique role as a foundational creator and nurturer of life, these activists betray women and use her for cheap political props. This is an attack on a woman’s amazing biological ability to bear and give birth to children. This is gender appropriation – stealing something precious that distinctly belongs to women, demeaning it, and distorting its purpose. Historically, women have fought to defend and protect their position and authority within society. Our spaces and institutions have value and therefore deserve respect and protection from encroachment of the entitled Lef
