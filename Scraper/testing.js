Undoing the harm done by the Iran nuclear deal needs to share the top of the agenda.In mid-October President Trump will bump up against a “certification” deadline imposed by the Iran Nuclear Agreements Review Act. The prompt was intended to ensure a much closer look at Iranian behavior and the Iran nuclear deal known as the “JCPOA.” Instead of sloughing off a threat that makes Hurricane Harvey look like an overflowing bathtub, this oversight duty must be taken far more seriously.Obama’s JCPOA is trumpeted primarily for one alleged achievement: it bought us time. In reality, it did precisely the opposite.  It bought Iran time. Instead of ratcheting up the pressure on Tehran on our terms and our timetable, Americans paid to give Iran time to hone missile delivery systems (Obama omitted from the deal) and get itself to the brink of acquiring a nuclear weapon before the JCPOA’s terrifying hourglass runs out.On August 3, 2017 Iranian President Rouhani said Iran will be able to start enriching uranium to 20% in the Fordo facility in only five days, and reactivate the reactor in Arak because cement was never poured into its core. His remarks were repeated on August 22, 2017 by the head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization, Ali Akbar Salehi.The Iran deal was exceptional for one other characteristic: it claims to put vital aspects of U.S. national security in the hands of non-Americans, the UN Security Council, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and our negotiation partners China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, the European Union and Iran.After all, President Obama went to the Security Council to adopt the Iran deal formally, and purportedly bind the United States in international law, before he took the deal to Congress. The complex regime for reinstating the sanctions that Obama tore up is intended to put American foreign relations in serious jeopardy should we calculate the necessities of our well-being deviate from the calculations of others.President Trump and Congress need to exercise their constitutional responsibility to move the center of gravity back where it belongs.In August, former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton (and Fox News contributor) publicly provided the administration with options.  In July Senators Cotton, Cruz, Perdue and Rubio called for “a sober accounting of Iran's JCPOA violations as well as the regime's aggressive and destabilizing behavior.” So where is it?A third rubber stamp of what candidate Trump called the “worst deal ever” is indefensible. Outsourcing our national security to the U.N. is not a plan.The IAEA has so far produced six reports on Iran’s implementation of the JCPOA. The agency has been careful to indicate, however, its reports are limited by “the modalities set out in the JCPOA.”Moreover, in late August U.N. Ambassador Haley pointed to “military sites” and “undeclared sites” which the IAEA had not asked to inspect – and to which, therefore, it had not been denied access.  Even IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano said in March that he has no idea how many years it will take to conclude that Iran has no undeclared nuclear material and activities – because “it depends very much on the level of cooperation from Iran.”  As recently as August 29, 2017, Iran’s government spokesman Mohammad Bagher Nobakht unilaterally declared military sites off limits.Step back and recall where Obama left off with “certifying” Iran’s good behavior. In November and December 2015 the IAEA issued its final pre-JCPOA reports and found: \"...the Agency is not in a position to provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran, and therefore to conclude that all nuclear material in Iran is in peaceful activities.\" Obama responded by simply shutting down any further investigation of Iran’s pre-JCPOA activities.So now, as then, we still don’t know what we don’t know. What we do know is that the IAEA had already specifically itemized, in 2011 and 2015, Iranian “activities that are relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device…” and “specific to nuclear weapons.”And we also know that the pre-JCPOA certification scam consisted of Iran self-reporting. It reads, for instance: “Iran will provide to the Agency [IAEA] photos…Iran will provide to the Agency videos…Iran will provide to the Agency seven environmental samples…”Moreover, the JCPOA continues to give Iran far more than it does the United States and its allies, since it granted – for the first time – an Iranian right to enrich uranium, and legitimized a regime that had correctly been an international pariah.The windfall that Obama gave the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism, and close North Korean collaborator, via the JCPOA is a sunk cost.  This Congress and this president have no excuses to continue sailing the American people into a storm from which they will never recover.Anne Bayefsky is director of the Touro Institute on Human Rights and the Holocaust.

To judge from the overheated reaction, left, right and Barack Obama agree on this. Color me curious.Once upon a time, we had a government where Congress fulfilled its part in the checks-and-balances system. But gradually, and almost totally on many issues, lawmakers became expert only at ducking and kicking everything to the White House.Because of that bipartisan cowardice, the estimated 800,000 dreamers remained an unresolved issue for many years. Obama said repeatedly he couldn’t solve it, only Congress can write the laws.Then, before the 2012 election, Obama changed his mind and, with a stroke of a pen, stopped deportations. But the “D” in DACA meant deferral, and everybody knew it was temporary and probably unconstitutional.The “D” in DACA meant deferral, and everybody knew it was temporary and probably unconstitutional.Congress, especially Republicans, was furious, and said it was their job.So now Trump, after zigs and zags, calls their bluff. It’s your job, he said, now do it.That’s what they wanted, and it’s how our system is supposed to work.

He explained that the Constitution does not allow the president the power to unilaterally change immigration law by executive order.Under DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), which was created by an executive order signed by President Obama in 2012, the federal government allowed children brought to the U.S. in violation of the law to get permits so they could stay here legally for two years at a time, with the ability to renew their permits.  President Obama said he issued the executive order because Congress was deadlocked and couldn’t reach agreement to pass legislation to fix our badly broken immigration system.Conservatives rightly assailed President Obama for assuming lawmaking jurisdiction, clearly usurping the constitutional authority of the Congress to pass laws.Even more egregiously, Obama achieved nothing but talk regarding immigration reform when he entered office in 2009 with a solidly Democratic Congress. He instead waited for a politically opportune time before the 2012 election to waive his scepter like a king and pronounced DACA as an edict.On the other side, many Hispanics and immigration advocates now correctly decry the threat of deportation facing Dreamers, who were brought to America by their parents and had no say in breaking our immigration laws.Congress should show heart and smarts through a three-part law that would help the Dreamers and at the same give America a sound immigration policy that serves our nation’s best interests.First, Congress must accede to the president’s insistence on a fully funded wall along our border with Mexico, which was clearly a foundational pillar of his 2016 victory. Our government has an obligation to secure our border.Second, DACA should be turned from an unconstitutional executive order into a law. But is should also be phased out, so that no more immigrants can sign up for the program. It is one thing to allow people already protected by DACA to stay here. It is quite another to make this a permanent program that would incentivize never-ending violations of our immigration laws.And third, the RAISE Act – supported by President Trump and sponsored by Republican Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Sonny Perdue of Georgia – should be approved by Congress. The legislation would transform our present chain-migration system based on relatives already in this country to one based on skills, so that we welcome the best and brightest of the world who also love our values.  Paradoxically, it is President Trump – so roundly and unjustly maligned by the mainstream media as anti-Hispanic – who stands uniquely positioned now to achieve this substantive immigration reform, and on “America First” terms.President Trump has, amazingly, largely secured our border only months into office and empowered U.S. Immigration and Customers Enforcement to accelerate the deportation of dangerous criminal illegal aliens.At the same time, the president clearly aches for the predicament of the Dreamers themselves. So he is in the best position to achieve a long-awaited solution to their uncertain immigration status.Many DACA residents know no other country, speak English as their primary language, work legally and raise children who are American-born.  I disagree with some of my Team Trump brethren who believe these 800,000 residents should be “returned to sender” to their birthplaces. In my view, they comprise a totally different category than adults who willfully broke our immigration laws.So Congress, I hope you enjoyed the August break that you didn’t deserve.

articles[4] = "\n                                     \n                                What happened?! Hillary Clinton obviously left off the question and exclamation marks from her book title, but no worries. If anyone has been confused about what happened last November, things were just cleared up by a simple meme on Twitter. The photo shows a copy of Hillary’s upcoming campaign memoir, “What Happened,” next to another book – titled “I Happened.” The second book cover shows a picture of a grinning President Donald Trump.Simple, funny and most of all, true.But if that answer isn’t enough for Hillary supporters, they have a chance to have Hillary personally tell them a fairy tale, but only if they cough up $150 to nearly $2,400 for tickets and the privilege of seeing her in the flesh.Hillary abandoned her supporters on election night, but hey, why go down to speak for free when you can wait until your book is finished and then charge everyone an arm and leg to hear your excuses for losing?The promotional material for the book tour wants to make sure you know how much of a victim Hillary really is: “She speaks about the challenges of being a strong woman in the public eye, the criticism over her voice, age, and appearance, and the double standard confronting women in politics.”The book tour promo material goes on to talk about the Russians. “She lays out how the 2016 election was marked by an unprecedented assault on our democracy by a foreign adversary. By analyzing the evidence and connecting the dots, Hillary shows just how dangerous the forces were that shaped the outcome.”Oh, so the Russians told Hillary to call half the electorate “deplorable” and “irredeemable?” Got it.            The truth is, in fact, boring and predictable. Hillary lost because of Hillary, including the conspiracy nonsense she peddles promoting “dangerous forces” as an excuse for her desperate inability to be honest and face reality. During the election, Hillary took supporters – and the American people in general – for granted.  And now she’s taking them for a ride. Just ask Democrats in Wisconsin, a state she couldn’t be bothered to visit during the campaign because, as the Borg know full well, resistance is futile.Until it’s not.So don’t fret Milwaukee! You are now on the list as Hillary is deigning to pay you a visit on the book tour. Yes, a year late, but she’s confident in her contempt, and she’s sure you’ll pay her to lecture you.On this day, as Houston is only really beginning to assess the damage of Hurricane Harvey, one wonders who could really use that $150 to nearly $2,400 that Hillary is pocketing for the pleasure of her company. People, their pets, and other animals who need rescuing from a hurricane’s bacteria-laden flood waters? Families who need shelter and food to survive the aftermath? Or a twice-failed multimillionaire politician looking to cash in on her latest fiasco?Tammy Bruce is a radio talk-show host, New York Times best-selling author and Fox News political contributor."
articles[5] = "\n                                     \n                                The most important thing to understand about President Trump's decision Tuesday to wind down the DACA program, which has allowed 800,000 immigrants brought to this country illegally as children to stay here, is just how legally shaky DACA was. Before issuing the executive order creating DACA – which stands for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals – President Obama had repeatedly said he did not have the authority to change immigration law on his own.President Obama then changed his mind. The courts, including the Supreme Court in 2016, enjoined a similar law for adults. Legal scholars predicted DACA would be declared invalid within a year.President Trump's decision to end DACA – but to allow a 6-month grace period so Congress can codify changes in the law that could let so-called Dreamers stay – is being attacked from left and right.To liberals, the president’s move represents the creation of heartless uncertainty. For conservatives, immigration hawk Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, says the president's action will touch off a \"big, civil war\" among Republicans. In reality, the president is this time keeping his cool and navigating the turbulent political waters here prudently.President Trump isn’t keeping the specifics of the DACA order, which grants a two-year renewable work permit to recipients while blocking any deportation actions against them unless a criminal record is involved. But President Trump says he will work with Congress to reach a viable solution.A statement by the president Tuesday echoes DACA supporters in one respect: \"I do not favor punishing children, most of whom are now adults, for the actions of their parents,\" President Trump said.Candidate Trump’s heated campaign rhetoric last year led many people to believe he really did want to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. But his attention-grabbing soundbites were belied by his previous positions on the subject.Back in 2012, when he was mulling over a run for president, Trump told an interviewer he was “probably down the middle” on immigration issues. After his election in 2016, he said he would focus on deporting \"bad hombres\" with criminal records and leave the Dreamers alone while the issue was sorted out. The genius of Trump on the campaign trail was that he sent two different messages on immigration.  On the one hand, he called for a border wall and bizarrely claimed he would get Mexico to pay for it. On the other hand, he said he would build a “big beautiful door” in the wall to let in legal immigrants. He reiterated that stand after the election, when he told a rally that he expected the wall would let in both legal immigrants and guest workers.With his acknowledgement Tuesday that he expected to sign a compromise on the Dreamer issue, President Trump is actually proving himself a good player in the game of the political two-step.  Activists on both sides of the political spectrum are upset, but the vast majority of voters in the middle will probably see it as a reasonable compromise. Of course, members of Congress are already posturing. Rep. Joe Crowley, D-N.Y., is accusing Trump of \"hostage taking\" should the president try to tie Dreamer status to, say, funding for his border wall.  But in the end, the political onus will be on Democrats if they block Dreamer legislation because they refuse to link it to any other issue. If President Trump plays his cards right, his move Tuesday is smart politics. With new guidelines in place that make it easier to deport unwanted or criminally minded immigrants, the president can feel free to be flexible and even generous with other immigrants.  The end result will satisfy neither President Trump’s most fanatical supporters nor his critics. But it is certainly likely to work better than the chaotic status quo on immigration.John Fund is a columnist for National Review. Follow him on Twitter @JohnFund."
articles[6] = "\n                                     \n                                Republicans have not convinced many everyday Americans of the rightness of our cause. So we need to do something different to get our message directly to the American people and explain how the policies we advocate will benefit them.To succeed, it’s time for Republicans to take the initiative and go on the offensive. We need to seize opportunities, streamline the legislative process, become less risk-adverse and not rely on the media to fairly deliver our message.Republicans also need to define issues, employ better arguments and make the Democrats pay a price for their unpopular positions. And we need to be as disciplined in governing as Democrats are in opposing.       Democrats attack. Republicans explain. Instead, Republicans should show the positive impact of our plans on the lives of individuals. And we should use charts, graphics, photos, social media and all the other tools of modern communication.Republicans are too defensive. Democrats are like predators that instinctively pursue their prey as soon as they see their backsides. Republicans should confront our opponents, not head for the tall grass.Republicans shy away from sensitive issues, such as immigration, even when our solutions are popular. For example, few issues garner 70 to 80 percent of the public’s support. But a program called E-verify does. It protects jobs for American workers rather than letting illegal immigrants take them.Other issues involving education, law enforcement, family and individual freedom are winners as well. Republicans should be as hungry for victories now as we were when Democrats controlled Congress.Some congressional gridlock could be reduced by Republicans ourselves.The House spends months on spending bills that will seldom become law and are not particularly liked by conservatives.The Senate allows Democrats to block consideration of hundreds of bills with a filibuster rule that dates back only to 1975, and which could be repealed easily.Republicans also could benefit by thinking of ourselves as bakers. We should realize that a half-loaf, or even a slice, is better than no bread at all. The legislator who refuses to change a word of a bill will never enact a meaningful law. There is rarely a touchdown pass in Congress; usually it’s just grinding out first-downs.There is a tendency, too, for Republicans to vote no: members of our party want time to look before they leap.But it’s wrong to compare what we are voting on with perfection, rather than with the Democrats’ liberal alternative. By only voting for perfect bills, we will pass very little legislation. And Republicans will then be considered part of the problem, not part of the answer to problems facing our nation and our people. That spells electoral disaster.Often Republicans let Democrats determine the terms of debate. Some of the nicer words Democrats use to describe Republicans are “vile,” “heartless” and “killers.”Republicans reciprocate by adopting the Democrats’ own language. For instance, they agree to call the media “mainstream” and Democrats “progressive” rather than the more pejorative term, “liberal.”Suppose Republicans took the initiative, defined issues, expedited the legislative process and became a united team. Would that guarantee success? It might help but, no, it wouldn’t turn the tide.Until Republicans acknowledge the elephant in the room – the need to combat pervasive and relentless liberal media bias – our agenda will languish.As a result, we will not be able to deliver our message because the media primarily give only one side of the story – the other side. Americans simply won’t hear what Republicans are saying. Or, if they do, our work will assuredly be presented in a negative way.For Republicans, the media is like having another self-funded liberal Democratic opponent.George Mason University Professor Tim Groseclose quantified the media’s bias and found that it was worth 5 percent of the vote. His calculation has never been refuted.So without a biased media, we would have had a President McCain, a President Romney, a President Trump landslide, and many more Republicans in Congress today.The media’s intent is to intimidate, silence and put Republicans on the defensive. It’s working. And Republicans are willing accomplices to the media’s manipulation.The threshold question is: Why do Republicans let the media tell us what to think? Why read liberal columnists? Why watch the liberal news? Ignore them!Republicans take the bait. We swallow it hook, line and sinker. When a reporter calls and asks Republicans to comment on the president, legislation, or the Republican Party, many eagerly comply.The result is inevitably an unwarranted and critical story about the divided GOP, our weak leaders or our flawed bills.Why Republicans respond at all – much less answer hypothetical and leading questions – is beyond understanding. It enables the media to influence GOP strategy and policy.As for President Trump, the Republican Party’s fortunes largely rise or fall with him. If the economy grows, if jobs are created, if the borders are secured, if taxes are lowered, Republicans will benefit. But these achievements won’t occur if the president is besieged by his own party and the media.The president has called the media “the opposition.” He has a point. He has received the highest percentage of negative coverage of any recent president.Two-thirds of Americans now think the media are hurting the country! And the media’s credibility is at a record low. Much of what the media report is exaggerated, biased or slanted, if not malicious.The Democratic Party’s enablers spend millions of a dollars on “war rooms” that provide members of the media with tainted information they readily disgorge to savage Republicans.What are Republicans going to do in response? For starters, we should cite examples of media bias in speeches, and in letters to editors and producers. We should form organizations that will educate the public about the facts and dangers of media bias.And we should flood social media with counterpoints to the liberal media and Democrats – the “mediacrats.”Media bias is a threat to our democracy. If the American people don’t get the facts, they can’t make good decisions. And if they can’t make good decisions, our democracy is at risk.For our country’s sake, let’s hope and pray that Republicans will succeed in being able to accurately present our ideas to the American people.Congressman Lamar Smith represents the 21st district of Texas in the House of Representatives and is the chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee."
articles[7] = "\n                                     \n                                North Korea made clear its determination this weekend to keep advancing its nuclear weapons program, conducting its sixth and most powerful underground nuclear test only hours after claiming it has now developed a hydrogen bomb that can reach United States with the potential to kill millions.I doubt the truth of the North’s boast that it has already developed an H-bomb that can be mounted on an intercontinental ballistic missile to wipe out a U.S. city or a city in another nation. But we could see the North achieve this frightening goal soon unless President Trump acts quickly and decisively.Just last month in an opinion piece for Fox News I reported that a Pentagon source told me North Korea was only 6 to 18 months away from developing an H-bomb. My source told me this weekend that he still believes that but added on Sunday morning that “nothing North Korea does now should really make us jump out of our seat. At this point, I rule out nothing.”Yikes.The new North Korean nuclear test and the nation’s claim to have an H-bomb are part of the same strategy. For dictator Kim Jong Un to have confidence in his advanced nuclear weapons and missile delivery system he wants to test them, potentially on several occasions.I would argue that North Korea likely can already hit the U.S. with a crude nuclear delivery capability – now. So it’s an urgent matter of national security for President Trump and his administration to act to contain the nuclear and missile capabilities that Kim already has. So far, despite what Pyongyang has told us, Kim has never tested anything with the destructive power of a hydrogen bomb. Although, North Korea’s test Sunday was the biggest ever – roughly three times the size of its nuclear explosion this time last year and more powerful than the atomic bombs the U.S. dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan in World War II.North Korea would also have to miniaturize any nuclear bomb to mount it on an ICBM. Again, this is something else that would take additional time and would be a big leap for Kim, as well as fit the new weapon onto a missile.But whether it happens in a few months or even two years from, there is little doubt that the North is headed toward possessing the most powerful bomb on the planet and a working delivery system to many parts of the world, including our homeland. I would argue that North Korea likely can already hit the U.S. with a crude nuclear delivery capability – now.  So it’s an urgent matter of national security for President Trump and his administration to act to contain the nuclear and missile capabilities that Kim already has.As a first step, it’s time to pull out all the stops to make sure we restrict the amount of financial resources going into North Korea and make it as hard as possible for Kim to build up his nuclear program and H-bomb designs.The goal of this new action – like the last set of sanctions passed by the U.N. Security Council just weeks ago – should be to limit the amount of money going into North Korea that helps fund its nuclear and missile programs.President Trump needs to act unilaterally to name, shame and sanction any businesses, organizations and governments that help launder money for North Korea or assist the rogue nation in evading past or present sanctions. The amount of laundered money that goes to North Korea could easily amount to billions of dollars a year.This anti-money laundering campaign will undoubtedly hurt China and its banks here in the U.S., but it’s a necessary step to ensure Beijing and Pyongyang understand that evading sanctions that the U.N., U.S. and other individual nations have imposed on the North will no longer be tolerated.Second, we need to massively ramp up our military footprint in the Asia-Pacific region. President Trump should deliver on President Obama’s promise and actually “pivot” or “rebalance” to Asia. This would make Asia our top national security priority outside of the defense of our homeland, no matter what the international crisis of the day is.That means that instead of 60 percent of U.S. naval assets being in the Pacific we should increase that number to 70 percent. These new assets should be a mix of attack and guided missile submarines as well as AEGIS destroyers that can defend against North Korean missile attacks.Third, our land-based missile defenses in East Asia need to be ramped up dramatically as well as at home. We should work quickly with Japan to deploy additional PAC-3 batteries as well as deploy the THAAD missile defense system there as well.Washington should also work to quickly expand the number of ground-based midcourse defense interceptors that we need to defend against a North Korean ICBM attack.On top of this, President Trump should make clear that it is the policy of the United States that we will never accept a nuclear North Korea, and that all options still and will always remain on the table.While Washington will not start a war with Pyongyang, Kim must know we would respond to any North Korean military attack with severe deadly force. And if Kim ever launched a nuclear attack, President Trump should also make clear that the portly pariah of Pyongyang would be signing his and his nation’s death warrant.Today we are paying the accumulated price of having not devoted the required attention to a national security challenge that should have been front and center for every U.S. administration for decades.And while we might not have a perfect plan to mitigate the danger coming from North Korea, we do have many strong options that can collectively keep our nation and our allies secure.Harry J.

Instead of acting as an impartial, honest fact-finder on behalf of the American people, Comey behaved like a partisan hack.The former FBI director’s reprehensible behavior both during and after his tenure surely validates the judgment of President Trump in firing a man totally unfit to oversee our most revered law enforcement agency in our nation.The new evidence is revealed in a letter sent Wednesday to FBI Director Christopher Wray from Republican Senators Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. The letter is a bombshell, and didn’t get anywhere near the media attention it deserves.The evidence disclosed by Grassley and Graham comes from the Office of Special Counsel, a government agency that investigated whether Comey violated the law when he was FBI director. The investigation was closed after Comey was fired. The new evidence shows that Comey drafted a memo exonerating Clinton of wrongdoing as early as April 2016, even though Clinton was not interviewed until July 2016.As Grassley and Graham correctly stated in their letter:  “conclusion first, fact-gathering second – that’s no way to run an investigation.”In fact, after Comey wrote his “nothing to see here” draft absolving Clinton of wrongdoing, the FBI still interviewed a total of 17 key officials. In addition to Clinton herself, State Department Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, who was appointed by Clinton and served under her, was also questioned. Mills received a very unusual immunity agreement from investigators. How is it possible that Comey had ascertained, at such an early date, that the evidence would not incriminate Hillary Clinton? Such a prejudicial judgment certainly reveals a shocking level of bias and a dangerous willingness to engage in partisan politics.Understandably, President Trump reacted to the new evidence with indignation, tweeting Friday: “Comey exonerated Hillary Clinton long before the investigation was over … a rigged system!” Many Americans had already concluded that Comey’s investigation of Clinton was a sham. The majority in a July 2016 Washington Post/ABC News poll disagreed with Comey’s decision to not seek an indictment against her.The American people were poorly served by an FBI director who shirked his duty as a public servant. They thankfully delivered their verdict on Clinton’s suitability for the Oval Office at the ballot box last November.Adding insult to injury, Comey’s deceptive practices extended beyond his FBI tenure.  Once he was fired by President Trump, he again showed his true colors by leaking confidential information to the media with the expressed intention of triggering a special counsel investigationComey’s pattern of unethical bias, plus his personal ties to Special Counsel Robert Mueller going back many years, seriously tarnish Mueller’s standing.Donald Trump triumphed in 2016 because he promised to “drain the swamp” in Washington.  Sadly, the swamp has proven resilient, from Capitol Hill to James Comey in obstructing the president’s transformational agenda.In the end, the will of the people must prevail and smash a rigged system that has stolen the dignity and prosperity of Americans.Steve Cortes is a Fox News contributor, former Trump campaign operative and spokesman for the Hispanic 100.

The media almost uniformly applied to the speech its favorite (though misused) descriptor: “populist.” But the real news was that Mr. Trump wants to make Reagan-style tax reform great again.The left saw this clearly, which explains its furious and frustrated reaction to the speech. “Trump’s New Tax Scam: Selling Plutocracy as Populism,” ran a headline in Vanity Fair, bemoaning that “Trickle-down is back, baby.” Democratic strategist Robert Shrum railed in a Politico piece that the “plutocrat” Mr. Trump was pitching a tax cut for “corporations and the top 1 percent” yet was getting away with a “perverted populism.” Trump voters had been “tricked into voting against themselves,” and now Mr. Trump was pulling a similar con with taxes.Nonsense. Mr. Trump is selling pro-growth policies—something his party has forgotten how to do. And there’s nothing very “populist” about it, at least not by today’s political standards. The left has defined the tax debate for decades in terms of pure class warfare. Republicans have so often been cast as stooges for the rich that the GOP is scared to make the full-throated case for a freer and fairer tax system. It was precisely the right’s desire for a more “populist” tax policy that gave us the Reformicons and their manifesto for buying off the middle class.To continue reading Kimberley Strassel's column in the Wall Street Journal, click here.Kimberley Strassel writes the Potomac Watch column for the Wall Street Journal where she is a member of the editorial board.

articles[10] = "\n                                     \n                                As the floodwaters slowly recede in Texas, the liberal media continue to relentlessly attack President Trump, despite the tremendous job he is doing to deal with Hurricane Harvey.  The president deserves a great deal of credit for working with congressional leaders to help fund recovery from the killer storm. Late Friday night the White House asked Congress for $7.85 billion to fund the continuing federal response to the hurricane. President Trump has also pledged $1 million of his own money to help victims.Yet media attacks harp on criticism of President Trump for his conduct on his first visit to Texas not long after Harvey hit.     ABC News, a supposedly impartial source of information, ran with the following headline: “Trump thanks Texas officials for hurricane response, barely addresses victims.”CNN’s headline was similarly backhanded: “Trump wins praise in Texas, but keeps empathy at bay.”A Newsweek reporter chose to defend his fellow media members, claiming “reporters are rescuing people in Texas” even “as Trump attacks the media.”  Others shifted to climate change, blaming President Trump’s pro-growth policies for the devastating flood damage.The first line of a New York Daily News story read: “When it rains under President Trump, the protections will be poor.”A Los Angeles Times editorial urged the president to recognize “climate change is a global threat” in light of Hurricane Harvey. As if hurricanes and floods haven’t existed for centuries.  Now that the tragedy in Charlottesville has left the front page, the liberal media can no longer so frequently exploit the despicable actions of white supremacists to smear President Trump. So journalists are using their stories on Hurricane Harvey to propagate their anti-Trump agenda.  Far too little attention is paid to the fact that the president expressed his support for Harvey’s victims, saying his heart “goes out even more so to the great people of Texas.” And even before that, the president mobilized federal resources and provided much-needed leadership under difficult circumstances. He continues to do this.In addition, President Trump and his wife made a second visit to Texas Saturday, landing in Houston.Imagine if President Obama received the same negative media coverage after the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, when he failed to name radical Islam as the cause of the carnage. Not a single mainstream news headline read: “Obama thanks first responders in Orlando, fails to mention radical Islam.”The same goes for the 2015 San Bernardino shooting or the infamous Benghazi attack in 2012. Not once did President Obama forcefully condemn radical Islamic terrorism by name, which never drew fire from the liberal media. In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, ABC News opted for a puffy human interest angle. A 2012 headline read: “Obama meets with parents who lost sons in Sandy.” The liberal media purposely positions President Trump in a lose-lose situation. The same media that attacked President George W. Bush for visiting post-Katrina New Orleans too late blames President Trump for visiting post-Harvey Texas too early.MSNBC whined about “real concern” regarding the president’s trip, suggesting it diverts valuable resources from the rescue effort. No one in the White House is immune. First Lady Melania Trump was widely criticized for wearing high heels as she boarded a helicopter on her way to a flight to Texas. This despite the fact that that she changed into sneakers once the plane touched down.The New York Times devoted several stories to Mrs. Trump’s high heels and alleged naiveté. One snarky headline read: “Melania Trump, off to Texas, finds herself on thin heels.” The attacks became so outrageous that even Trevor Noah, the liberal host of “The Daily Show,” stood up for the first lady. The mainstream media should be ashamed. When the press exploits a natural disaster to score political points, it ultimately does a disservice to the victims who have lost everything in Hurricane Harvey’s floodwaters. Our attention should be focused on them, the first responders, the continued rescue effort and federal aid being provided – not anti-Trump zingers and high heels.  Countless videos have revealed truly awe-inspiring heroism on the streets of Houston and other parts of Texas. Americans of all backgrounds are helping each other stay safe. Ignore the fake news, watch these videos and pray for the people of Texas.Ted Harvey is chairman of the Committee to Defend the President."

The Trump administration has already made significant strides toward getting the economy back on track, especially when it comes to regulatory reform – progress that’s been reflected in the markets.The Trump administration, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in particular under the leadership of Administrator Scott Pruitt, have taken a “smart growth” approach to cutting red tape and rolling back regulations.  Contrary to what many on the left may say, Trump and Pruitt are not anti-regulation as long as regulations aren’t overly costly and burdensome and they don’t hinder or hurt American job growth that is the administration’s top priority.As evidence, Pruitt was right to defend the EPA’s Significant New Alternatives Policy or SNAP program when companies from France and Mexico sued in federal court to have it scrapped. A three-judge panel ruled in a split decision, 2-1, to get rid of this program but there’s a chance the full court could reverse the ruling if Pruitt appeals. This ruling was unfortunate, as it permitted foreign companies to transcend U.S. private sector investment and innovation that led to job growth here at home and the exporting of new technology around the world.  American ingenuity, combined with over a billion dollars of private investment – without a dime coming from the federal treasury – resulted in the development of new, safer environmental technology, only to see a court side with foreign companies.The EPA program that created the landscape for these innovative, new technologies is actually rooted in the conservative environmental stewardship of former President Ronald Reagan and former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Pruitt should stand up for American investment, innovation and our workers by appealing this decision as there’s a chance the full court may side with him and the Trump administration.In urging him to do so, former conservative presidential candidate Steve Forbes noted the ruling hurts U.S. companies and workers who invest and innovate.  As Bloomberg News Intelligence chemicals analyst Christopher Perrella noted, “It’s good for the companies and it’s good for the planet. That’s a win-win regardless of your thoughts on climate change.”Under the EPA’s program new chemical technologies that meet the market demand for certain products were developed with nary a dime from the federal treasury. These new chemicals, known as HFOs, are primarily used for refrigeration in homes, in cars, in mass transit and elsewhere. If the ruling stands, private sector investment of over a billion dollars will have been for naught. The fallout could be even worse as the ruling will likely create a chilling effect (no pun intended) over American industry, as why should companies risk investing in the future only to have a court pull the rug out from under them?Thus the ruling, while initially unfortunate, presents an opportunity for Pruitt and the Trump administration to demonstrate its support for American industry’s ingenuity and innovation – and the workers who provide it – as well as its support for effective environmental stewardship. The economy is beginning to turn in the right direction and the United States is poised to be a leader on multiple fronts – including investment, development of needed technology, and the exporting of these products around the globe – which will only mean more good paying jobs for the American people.Ken Blackwell, a former domestic policy adviser to the Trump/Pence Transition Team, is a former Secretary of State and State Treasurer for the state of Ohio and former mayor of Cincinnati."

And while you claim your name means you’re anti-fascist, you’ve shown by your actions that you’re really anti-American and anti-freedom.You’ve assaulted hundreds of President Trump’s supporters at rallies. You’ve vandalized property in the nation’s capital after the Trump inauguration. And you’ve gone on an arson rampage because you were upset that former Breitbart News Senior Editor Milo Yiannopoulos was supposed to speak at the University of California, Berkeley. In Charlottesville, you arrived on the scene with clubs and shields, prepared to commit violence.  Instead, your sick plans were superseded by the monstrous behavior of neo-Nazis, Ku Klux Klan members and other right-wing extremists as lunatic as you are. But they don’t have much of the liberal media working as agit-prop wings for them every day, like you do.If there’s anything you Antifa members hate it’s free speech, the Bill of Rights and the United States of America. In this, you have a lot in common with the fascists you denounce, as well as communist tyrants.Last Sunday, near your operational headquarters in Berkeley, you proved again that you are a nest of Marxist vipers. You went on yet another violent rampage, attacking innocent conservative men and women who were holding a peaceful rally.That’s your modus operandi: intimidation of anyone you deem your enemy through organized violence. You believe you are always right, those you disagree with you are always wrong, and as a result you are justified in physically attacking them to shut them up.If there’s anything you Antifa members hate it’s free speech, the Bill of Rights and the United States of America. In this, you have a lot in common with the fascists you denounce, as well as communist tyrants.You so-called anti-fascists are really nothing more than communists yourselves, aren’t you? I’m sure it’s no coincidence that your banner resembles the German Communist Party flag from the 1920’s.No doubt you believe that you’re on a roll and that through further assaults and intimidation you’ll be able to change the political climate and remake our nation into Soviet American Union.Nothing could be further from the truth. Here’s what’s going to happen:Your group is going to be destroyed – either by law enforcement, or by average Americans, or by both.At the end of the day, you will be piled on the ash heap of history with a myriad of other thugs, authoritarian movements and tyrants from the past.You’ve had a field day picking on college millennials and unarmed reporters. You’ve cold-cocked Trump supporters with rocks and attacked conservative women with pepper spray. And all the while, local police were forced to look on helplessly, under orders from liberal mayors who support “the resistance.”Newsflash for you: You haven’t actually met the real resistance yet, but with your determination for violence and bloodshed you probably will.The real resistance consists of millions of veterans, patriots and hard-working Americans who are sick and tired of Antifa violence and suppression of free speech. Many of these patriots would rather die than let the Bill of Rights be trampled on and incinerated by domestic terrorists like you. Of course, you could just stop being violent, stop suppressing free speech and go home. Then we could all live peacefully as free men and women in the greatest country on earth.But history has taught us that people like you are not going to stop. Therefore, you’d be wise to heed the words of the Bible and Matthew: ‘Those who live by the sword die by the sword.”You might want to put down your copy of \"Rules for Radicals,\" take off your goggles and masks, and think about that.More and more Americans are on to you. Despite your name, we know you are outlaws who embrace violence and hatred of America in the same way as the communists, the Nazis, Al Qaeda and ISIS.  Ray Starmann is the founder of US Defense Watch.

articles[13] = "\n                                     \n                                On Inauguration Day, leftwing protesters took to the streets of the nation’s Capital. They burned cars, shattered store fronts, blocked off checkpoints leading to the Capitol grounds, pelted police officers with rocks, and harassed law-abiding Americans trying to watch our 45th President take his oath of office.Police in downtown Washington arrested 217 of these so-called Antifa militants during what CNN called “ugly street clashes.” On the same day, police arrested even more violent leftwing protestors in New York, Chicago, Portland, Dallas, and other cities across the nation.The elite media went to great lengths to portray these attacks as isolated incidents. National news outlets emphasized the peaceful demonstrations by other distraught liberals, while conveniently neglecting to mention the many Americans who were peacefully enduring Antifa’s abuse. By the next day, most of the media had abandoned the topic all together, shifting their focus to more “pressing” issues, like comparing the size of the 2017 inauguration crowd with the attendance of previous years.Thus, the Left’s violence was concealed. But this was only the beginning.NPR described the attack as “scattered violence,” claiming it was “unclear how the aggressors were aligned.” Even after citing another journalist who said the violence was caused by members of Antifa, the network made sure to add that “the man being beaten may have been a member of the alt-right.”In February, leftwing protestors at the University of California, Berkeley rioted – causing $100,000 in damage to the campus – and forced the university to cancel a speech by former Breitbart.com editor Milo Yiannopoulos.A month later at Middlebury College, liberals shouted down political scientist and author Charles Murray, preventing him from giving a speech. As if this wasn’t enough to satisfy these rioters, a group of masked militants then proceeded to attack Murray, injuring a faculty member in their fury.In an attempt to rationalize the violent outbursts of leftist groups, the mainstream media characterized the speakers as controversial, provocative right-wingers whose extreme views drove the otherwise normal liberal Americans into frenzy.After the tragic events in Charlottesville, Virginia this month, the media rightly castigated violence carried out by hateful Neo-Nazi groups and Ku Klux Klan members, but they blatantly disregarded the violent acts committed by Antifa militants who were also there.In San Francisco this past Sunday, a small army of masked, armed Antifa members swarmed and attacked a group of conservatives who were peacefully protesting Marxism in America – as well as the police protecting the group. The Berkeley Police ultimately arrested 13 of the Antifa activists, charging some with felony assault, assault with a deadly weapon, and other violations.This was a clear, coordinated offensive on innocent Americans exercising their rights to free speech, protest, and assembly. The victims of this attack were not advocating for hate, racism, or any other malign or violent philosophy. They were opposing communism – a political system which most Americans have opposed for decades.  However, once again, members of the elite media have failed to condemn this violence – and instead have worked tirelessly to mute and downplay terror being committed by fellow liberals.On Monday, NPR described the attack as “scattered violence,” claiming it was “unclear how the aggressors were aligned.” Even after NPR cited another journalist who said the violence was caused by members of the leftwing Antifa group, the network made sure to add that “the man being beaten may have been a member of the alt-right.”Huffington Post writer Andy Campbell described the liberal aggression as “scuffles” in a piece that included the triumphant liberal subhead, “A Rally that Had Been Called Off Got Drowned Out, Anyway.” Campbell implied in his article that both groups engaged in violence and were arrested, which was completely, intentionally false.The Washington Post’s coverage acknowledged that Antifa was responsible, but they unsurprisingly managed to indirectly blame President Donald Trump. They asserted that violence “has become a regular feature” of his presidency and “gives signs of spiraling upward, particularly in the wake of the violence in Charlottesville.”So, the elite national media’s take on the violence in Berkeley on Sunday was: Yes, violent liberals attacked a small group of conservative protestors – but it’s not really their fault.Based on how the mainstream media has covered the Charlottesville tragedy and the protests in Berkeley, it is reasonable to say they believe there is no moral equivalence between violence fueled by bigotry and violence committed by people who hate others for their political ideology.This message is wrong and dangerous to our Republic.Even the few outside news outlets that accurately reported the event in Berkeley as a clear assault by leftwing activists on police and peaceful protestors, still failed to condemn these acts as threats to free speech and peaceable assembly – the foundation of our Constitution’s First Amendment.Prolonged silence about the Left’s violence is dangerous. It’s time for the national media to reflect and start condemning leftwing attacks just as vehemently as it does the brutality of Neo-Nazis, the KKK, and other hateful groups.Violence in all forms is wrong and must be harshly rebuked by all Americans.Newt Gingrich is a Fox News contributor.

articles[14] = "\n                                     \n                                As Harvey made landfall and was wreaking havoc in Texas, there was another sort of destruction unfolding in Berkeley, California, this one of the human variety. On August 27th, hundreds of Antifa, the black-clad violent fascist anarchists, set like locusts upon about 20 peaceful sign-holding Trump supporters in a Berkeley park, threatening, chasing and beating them.Yet something different happened after this typical scene of Antifa-organized violence—a major American newspaper told the truth. The Washington Post’s headline was shocking, not because of the subject matter, but because it actually reflected the facts of the matter on the ground: “Black-clad antifa members attack peaceful right-wing demonstrators in Berkeley.”The end result of the attack was like every other Antifa riot—people were injured, some sent to hospitals, and over a dozen Antifa were arrested.Up until Berkeley, which was not even one of Antifa’s most violent actions, the media had soft-pedaled the group’s violence. Reporters and journalists, inexplicably, generally refused to name them in coverage and worked to cast their violence as self-defense or action against “haters” or of course, the now ubiquitous “fascists.”Other headlines around the country about their brutality continued to obscure the true nature of what Antifa was doing. The San Francisco Chronicle announced, “Berkeley police identify 13 people arrested amid violence at right-wing rally.”The August 28 Washington Post headline and article, which bluntly laid out the truth of the violence by Antifa at Berkeley, sent a message to the liberal political and media world: that the romance was over.The Los Angeles Times: “Protests in Berkeley turn violent as counter-protesters, pro-Trump forces clash.” Really? There was no clashing, unless you consider a father and son Trump supporters running for their lives a “clash.” Antifa didn’t “turn” violent, they came ready to inflict harm.CNN’s coverage of Antifa has been Orwellian and even seemingly sympathetic. With a headline (eventually scrubbed) that actually noted, “Unmasking the Leftist Antifa Movement: Activists Seek Peace Through Violence,” they then compared Antifa’s rhetoric to Founding Father John Adams.Antifa is not new. The media know who they are and what they do. They are an extension of the “Black Bloc” anarchists best known for their violent actions at World Trade Organization and G8 gatherings. They were a part of the now defunct Occupy movement. Their current incarnation is as laughably absurd fascist anti-fascists.Reporters have been the subject of Antifa violence. One was arrested at Charlottesville for punching a female reporter for “The Hill.”On Twitter, various journalists reported being attacked or seeing assaults by Antifa on other reporters. Also at Charlottesville, Katie Couric tweeted that she and her production team were sprayed with urine, a regular assault tactic of Antifa.At a rally in Richmond, Virginia, one day after the Charlottesville horror, a local CBS reporter was hospitalized after being struck in the head with an object. Antifa admitted the assault on social media, which the reporter said began after the thugs ordered him to stop filming, which he refused.Then finally, the Washington Post story, out of the blue, naming and blaming Antifa, while at the same time making it clear the “right wing” victims were peaceful. In part, the media sees the message of anti-Trump Antifa as helpful to their anti-Trump narrative.After all, we’re told, Mr. Trump’s election signals the spread of racism throughout America. How better to facilitate that narrative than to elevate and highlight people who claim the urgent need to attack America’s growing problem with fascism?The August 28 Washington Post headline and article, which bluntly laid out the truth of the violence by Antifa at Berkeley, sent a message to the liberal political and media world: that the romance was over.Some didn't get the message right away. Just a few hours after the Post’s story, the headline in New York Magazine’s \"Daily Intelligencer\" column was “Antifa beats up Trump supporters, Fuels Right-Wingers.” Their spin against Antifa wasn’t that mindless, anarchic violence against innocent people was bad, it was “images of defenseless Trump supporters being mobbed by their ideological nemeses lent stark visual support to the conservative narrative that antifa is a menace equivalent to white nationalism.”Yet 24 hours later, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi issued a statement condemning Antifa which in part read, “The violent actions of people calling themselves antifa in Berkeley this weekend deserve unequivocal condemnation, and the perpetrators should be arrested and prosecuted…”It’s arguable that media’s choice to coddle Antifa came at a time when liberals believed it would help their narrative casting Mr. Trump and his supporters, as racists. That did not work, and in fact is backfiring.The Washington Post sent a message that the party was over. At least now perhaps we can expect more in media to be honest about Antifa and its violent agenda. Tammy Bruce is a radio talk-show host, New York Times best-selling author and Fox News political contributor."
articles[15] = "\n                                     \n                                Editor’s note: The following column originally appeared in the Washington Times.America is reeling from the onslaught of Hurricane Harvey. In the midst of the suffering from the unparalleled flooding, we have seen remarkable examples of heroism and community coming to the aid of those in peril.Americans have been enduring for weeks media, the political class and their operatives malevolently insisting that all of America is hopelessly racist and its president a facilitator of white supremacists, so watching Texans helping their stricken neighbors has been a good reminder of who we, as Americans, really are.This is a small silver lining of a horrible event, as various malcontents continue to push on with their attempts to cast America as irredeemably irredeemable.Warnings of a “slippery slope” are often heard, especially when extremists demand the removal of statues they deem offensive. There are very sincere people calling for the removal of Confederate statues, but the organized left behind the hysteria are self-styled Marxists, specifically the World Workers Party, and anarchists, like Antifa.Attacks on a variety of cultural symbols is necessary to send a message that America was born of racism, is still racist and must be dismantled.Their concerns are not racism or even being offended; their goal is to condemn the United States and capitalism. For them, the only way to remake society is to rebuild it from ashes.Attacks on a variety of cultural symbols is necessary to send a message that America was born of racism, is still racist and must be dismantled.Cases in point: A CBS New York headline: “New York City ‘Symbols Of Hate’ Purge Could Target Columbus Statue, Grant’s Tomb.” President Grant, you see, is regarded by some as anti-Semitic.ESPN removing a sportscaster named Robert Lee from working a University of Virginia game to avoid imagined backlash, is now infamous. It was also so incomprehensible many, including this columnist, simply didn’t believe it. It was true, and a sign of how perceived public pressure as promulgated by media, and the fear of violence, produces a mass hysteria that facilitates the craven Marxist agenda embraced by so few.We also now have what is known as the “Traveler Mascot Controversy.” You see, the University of Southern California’s mascot’s horse has a name similar to Robert E. Lee’s horse, ergo, Traveler must go. Free Beacon reports, “Saphia Jackson, USC’s Black Student Assembly co-president, accused Traveler IX last week of being a symbol of white supremacy, and said it should be removed from campus.”The good news is someone is standing up to this absurdity: “An acclaimed sports broadcaster [Brent Musberger] said Sunday on Barstool Sports’ podcast ‘Pardon My Take’ that he would not vote for University of Southern California quarterback Sam Darnold to receive the Heisman Trophy if the university were to change its mascot’s name,” The Washington Free Beacon reported.But let’s not stop there. A writer at Salon, a far-left website, has declared, according to The Daily Caller, that “The Star-Spangled Banner” is America’s national anthem because “neo-Confederates elevated” the song “as a way of honoring Southern slaveowners’ rebellion.” The reasoning behind all this, the writer attests, is due to the “popular awakening” reflected in the demand to remove offensive statues.Not everything is as camera-ready as the defacing, beheading and tearing down of statues. After featuring the iconic American film, “Gone with the Wind” for 34 years, a Memphis theater announced it will no longer screen the film once a year at its festival.The New York Times noted the theater was removing it due to its “insensitive” nature and because of a “heated” online discussion. The decision was met with even more discussion, online and in the press.USA Today reported on the social media outrage, “Even a French cultural icon, erudite philosopher and cineaste Bernard-Henri Levy, had something to say in 140 characters, joining right-wing critics in condemning restraint on free expression. ‘Appalled by #Gonewiththewind cancellation at Memphis Orpheum Theater: alarming suppression of artistic expression,’ Mr. Levy declared on Twitter.”Columnist John Nolte perfectly notes on the fecklessness of the censors, “There is no moral difference between a community library bullied into removing a book and a community theater bullied into canceling a screening. Moreover, there is no moral difference between a mob burning a book and a mob bullying a film group into memory-holing a movie.”The good news in all of this bullying by a few hostile Marxists, who can organize online, are the facts of the matter. Mr. Nolte points out that 73 percent of African-Americans “rank ‘Gone With the Wind’ as a good/very good movie? That is only 14 points lower than whites. Our media would never tell you that. Doesn’t fit the narrative.”Moreover, in the wake of Charlottesville, the Federalist reported that a new poll “shows that most Americans, including a plurality of African-Americans, don’t agree with efforts to tear down Confederate statues. According to a new poll conducted by Marist for NPR/PBS News Hour, 62 percent of Americans want the statues to stay where they are.”One message for all of us is to not let volume or intensity of news coverage dictate reality. These issues are complex even without agitation from leftists who have no one’s best interests in mind. Having serious discussions about who we are as Americans has allowed us to become better people. If we acquiesce to a small cadre of leftist bullies and censors, they’ll not only wipe away the past, the future is gone as well.Tammy Bruce is a radio talk-show host, New York Times best-selling author and Fox News political contributor."
